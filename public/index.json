The art of winning, if you will.\nOne of most outstanding features of the Guild is their roadmap consisting of bite-sized exercises aimed at developing life skills.\nEach Skill belongs to one of the three Archetypes and we have Skills for everything from rationality to exercise to haggling. Generally speaking, each Archetype focuses on specific areas:\nPragmatist: Direct life improvement, making money, and networking Meditative: Mental and physical health, art, and community Empiricist: Learning, teaching, and clear thinking [‚Ä¶] Each Archetype can be worked on separately, allowing you to specialize and pursue what you find most rewarding. Real people are complex mixes of all three Archetypes, and the Path reflects that.\nA screenshot of the map starting point from the Guild homepage. Somehow I haven\u0026rsquo;t mentioned yet just how GORGEOUS this site is. Yes, I do love this map, and the image above is just a small piece of what awaits a guild member.\n(sadly, the map is kinda buggy on phone, so I recommend using laptop for the best experience)\nTo obtain a skill, the participant sometimes has to reflect on a task and submit their notes on site or share their findings at the Guild Discord server. I think it‚Äôs a rather interesting learning format: this way newcomers can go through the same exercises, yet provide new insights based on their own unique experiences. Grayspaces with rather soft built-in gradients are pretty cool.\nIt seems, however, that the most active days of this community are gone.

Come out of it‚Ä¶\nA character who you ‚Äì the protagonist \u0026amp; the viewer ‚Äì start hating because he is so cool‚Ä¶ But after a while you realize that yeah, he‚Äôs awesome and you actually can‚Äôt hate him despite the fact that he‚Äôs better than you in almost every sense (which makes you feel inferior)‚Ä¶\nThe thing is ‚Äì I DIDN‚ÄôT feel all of these while watching the movie (maybe because I‚Äôve seen too many spoilers beforehand). Yeah, Hobie had that parody vibe, but I always thought that his parody is intentional. He‚Äôs the punk, after all. Why would one expect him to adhere to whatever forced standards of seriousness?\nYet this video makes something in my brain move. I didn‚Äôt have these feelings; nonetheless, I recognize them. I recognize the insecurity.\nOn personal level, can‚Äôt help but note the darker side of belonging as well ‚Äì ‚Äúno one who acts out of the line and no one who doesn‚Äôt belong‚Äù is allowed in the Spider-society, where every single person has to survive a trauma of losing a significant other. And how dare you say these sacrifices aren‚Äôt necessary? Either you comply or you get thrown away. Must be easy to be accepting when you accept only those who agree with you, y‚Äôknow.\nThe main takeaway of this video from the media criticism standpoint is that depth isn‚Äôt about how many facts the audience knows about a character, it‚Äôs about presentation. And yeah, creators can put a lot of heart into intricate worlds and it‚Äôs incredibly tempting to show viewers EVERYTHING‚Ä¶ But extremely detailed worldbuilding doesn‚Äôt necessarily compensate for boring dynamics between characters, and/or non-existent plot, and/or any other things that can break the viewer‚Äôs :suspension of disbelief. But more can be achieved with less, and five minutes of total screen time can give the audience a lot to think about.\n","date":"October 21, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sources/when-a-deep-character-pretends-to-be-shallow...-hobie-brown-schnee/","section":"Sources","summary":"","title":"üé• When a DEEP Character Pretends to be SHALLOW...

And in truth, I didn‚Äôt write much (at least, not much that I cared about). Then I got a cold email from Robin. I almost never respond to cold emails (and I‚Äôve never taken a cold phone call in my life), but this one was different from the usual sort [...], so I responded. Suffice it to say, Robin got my attention, and kept it, and we began meeting, and talking, and reading together, and not long after, writing together. Thank you, Robin, for waking up my brain again, for being my muse, for knowing exactly how to finish my sentences and for letting me finish yours. Working with you has been like working with my own younger self, if my younger self had known back then what I know now 20 years later, but still had some energy and vitality left in me. Alicia A.

Aella, The Difficulty in Dating Good Men (2025). https://aella.substack.com/p/the-difficulty-in-dating-good-men 2025-10-13 [A]s Oliver Burkeman advises in Meditations for Mortals there is freedom in realizing that you won‚Äôt get everything done, that most of your tasks don‚Äôt matter and you should let them go because you‚Äôre never going to do them. They‚Äôre not valuable enough to bother with. The problem isn‚Äôt that you haven‚Äôt found the right tool to control your tasks, it‚Äôs that you think it‚Äôs possible to control every task that flows your way. The reason a new tool, or a new system for that matter, feels so good is that you give up on so many of the tasks that were weighing you down in the old system. You don‚Äôt move every idea over figuring that you‚Äôll come back to them at some point, and then you never come back.

Which is technically true. But only because the diagnosis of autism wasn‚Äôt officially recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) until 1980. Which is after RFK Jr was a kid. So yes, there was no autism when he was a kid. But it‚Äôs not because there was anything special and healthy about being a kid in the 50s and 60s.

Anyone who has worked in any spam and abuse role knows that these platforms are under fire and adversarial attack basically all the time. Which makes me think Krugman‚Äôs take is way too simplistic. ‚ÄúEnshittification is their fault. They are doing it on purpose because .‚Äù Krugman is definitely pointing to a real phenomenon, and his writing is insightful as usual. But like many of those critical of the modern tech landscape, Krugman only points the cannons of his criticism outward. Point me to some form of enshittification, and I'll find someone abusing the system that is making it worse for everyone. Honestly, most of the time I can't even blame them. Sure, I'm not personally like trashing my Airbnbs and then suing the host, or whatever.

I feel uncomfortable treating it like an invader (although I still do it sometimes because of social pressure). There can be a lot of healing in surrendering the narrative and all the power and authority it gives you. I don't mean that you have to abandon it entirely, it's useful, after all - but evicting it from a place of identity inside yourself is necessary. If your wound is held open by a sense of wrongness, it will never have space to heal.

How mean of you! I\u0026rsquo;m not a bad person, I\u0026rsquo;ve done X, Y, and Z!\nIt isn\u0026rsquo;t always this explicit; I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss more concrete instances in order to clarify. The important thing to realize is that A is pointing at a concrete problem (and likely one that is concretely affecting them), and B is changing the subject to be about B\u0026rsquo;s own self-consciousness. Self-consciousness wants to make everything about itself; when some topic is being discussed that has implications related to people\u0026rsquo;s self-images, the conversation frequently gets redirected to be about these self-images, rather than the concrete issue. Thus, problems don\u0026rsquo;t get discussed or solved; everything is redirected to being about maintaining people\u0026rsquo;s self-images.\nFunnily enough, while I was choosing colors for the cards above I‚Äôve reread the excerpt above a few times and realized that self-consciousness is one of the reasons why I felt so lonely. ‚ÄúSelf-consciousness wants to make everything about itself‚Äù, and I definitely felt it. Standing alongside someone and waiting when the conversation will switch to something I can talk about, scrolling personal blogs of my acquaintances hoping that I‚Äôll see the traces of me in their posts‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs difficult to pinpoint right away, but there‚Äôs definitely something connecting being ashamed of oneself, rejection sensitivity, lack of agency in relationship, the need to belong and the perceived lack of acceptance from the others.\nLike, thinking about oneself too much makes one lonelier, feeling lonely makes one more self-conscious, resulting in even more loneliness‚Ä¶\nAlso the issue ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to express that I emphasize without sharing my own experiences vs It‚Äôs annoying when people change the subject to themselves‚Äù seems to be pretty relevant.\nI mean, relevant to general :self-consciousness topic, namely ‚Äúa preoccupation with oneself, especially with how others might perceive one\u0026rsquo;s appearance or one\u0026rsquo;s actions‚Äù. However, I‚Äôm prone to reflect on my own relationships, while Jessica\u0026rsquo;s post is about politics and epistemologically faulty ways to protect one‚Äôs place in social hierarchy. I‚Äôm thinking about self-consciousness of a person who doesn\u0026rsquo;t belong, while Jessica writes about self-consciousness as a reason to attack someone who‚Äôs threatening one‚Äôs place within a community.\nReturning to the original post, I definitely want to share + save for later some quotes about common ego-protective tactics:\nA :tone argument criticizes an argument not for being incorrect, but for having the wrong tone. Common phrases used in tone arguments are: \u0026ldquo;More people would listen to you if\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;you should try being more polite\u0026rdquo;, etc. [‚Ä¶] Tone arguments are about people protecting their self-images when they or a group they are part of (or a person/group they sympathize with) is criticized. When a tone argument is made, the conversation is no longer about the original topic, it\u0026rsquo;s about how talking about the topic in certain ways makes people feel ashamed/guilty.

No part of this book may be reprinted or reproduced or utilised in any form or by any electronic, mechanical, or other means, now known or hereafter invented, including photocopying and recording, or in any information storage or retrieval system, without permission in writing from the publishers.\nThe newest edition of Soluzioni: A Practical Grammar of Contemporary Italian combines an engaging reference and grammar practice explained in clear and concise language with numerous supporting exercises. Aimed at keen students of all levels, Soluzioni also has a companion website at www.routledge.com/cw/derome which provides further resources for students and instructors. There are 240 free interactive language quizzes, plus supplementary downloadable material such as a comprehensive verb section and full answer key. This fifth edition continues the accessible methodology and focus on contemporary usage that has made Soluzioni the clearest pedagogic grammar book on the market today. Fully updated, it covers key areas of difficulty such as tense usage (including the subjunctive), causative verbs, combined pronouns and word order. It also pays attention to the links between grammar and communicative functions as well as those between grammar, context and register. Suitable for class use and independent study, Soluzioni is the ideal reference and practice resource for learners of Italian.\nAn EXTREMELY thorough textbook. It won‚Äôt be suitable for learning Italian as a beginner, since the amount of information is rather overwhelming, but otherwise it‚Äôs an excellent resource for more proficient students who‚Äôd like to get a better understanding of grammar \u0026amp; Italian teachers.\nFor a while the 4th edition of Soluzioni was my go-to textbook for What I Know About Italian project. However, the book is so concise yet comprehensive that I started to fear that I would run into copyright issues sooner of later if I ever publish these posts so I largely had to switch to textbooks with more permissive licenses.\n(As with all WIKAs, it can be quite difficult to not run into copyright issues ‚Äì not because I copypaste textbooks directly into my notes, but because it‚Äôs rather difficult to say something new when you‚Äôre a learner and not a teacher yet strive for completeness. It‚Äôs more difficult with STEM subjects, especially when you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to express these ideas in a different way. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons why during the first half a year I haven\u0026rsquo;t published any WIKA posts)\n","date":"October 8, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sources/soluzioni---a-practical-grammar-of-contemporary-italian/","section":"Sources","summary":"","title":"üìî Soluzioni: A Practical Grammar of Contemporary Italian„ÄàDenise De R√¥me„Äâ","type":"sources"},{"content":"","date":"October 8, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/books/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Books","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"October 8, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/italian-grammar/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Italian Grammar","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"October 8, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/italian-language/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Italian Language","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"October 8, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ableism/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ableism","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"October 8, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/discussions/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Discussions","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"October 8, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/lay-theories/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Lay Theories","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"October 8, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/neurodivergent-experiences/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Neurodivergent Experiences","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"October 8, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/personality-disorders/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Personality Disorders","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"October 8, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/psychiatry/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Psychiatry","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"October 8, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/stereotypes/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Stereotypes","type":"tags"},{"content":"https://www.tumblr.com/strangestcase/727107448123572224/i-think-people-would-armchair-diagnose-bad-people Title: N/A\nAuthor: strangestcase\nURL: https://www.tumblr.com/strangestcase/727107448123572224/i-think-people-would-armchair-diagnose-bad-people\nDate: 2023-08-30\n","date":"October 8, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sources/i-think-people-would-armchair-diagnose-bad-people-with-cluster-b-disorders-much-less.../","section":"Sources","summary":"","title":"üó£ I think people would armchair diagnose bad people with cluster B disorders much less...","type":"sources"},{"content":"","date":"October 4, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/collections/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Collections","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"October 4, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/creativity-example/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Creativity Example","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"October 4, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/experimental-video-games/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Experimental Video Games","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"October 4, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/video-games/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Video Games","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026#34;Spiritual Successors\u0026#34; Info \u0026amp; FAQ\nby u/ireallylikechikin in DiscoElysium Title: \u0026ldquo;Spiritual Successors\u0026rdquo; Info \u0026amp; FAQ\nAuthor: ireallylikechikin\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/1lxnvwy/spiritual_successors_info_faq/\nIn (hopefully) the shortest and best way I could, I‚Äôve put together an incredibly brief guide on what‚Äôs going on with these ‚Äúspiritual successors‚Äù that everyone keeps talking about.

Ample experimental research has been carried out on this topic, but these studies hardly reflect everyday language behavior. In the current corpus study, we reassessed previously found experimental results, but now in a Twitter corpus containing 17,432 tweets with homophonous verb forms. In accordance with previous results, we found a clear preference for the suffix -\u0026lt;d\u0026gt; compared to both -\u0026lt;dt\u0026gt; and -\u0026lt;t\u0026gt; , as well as a frequency effect, resulting in fewer errors for more frequent word forms. Furthermore, the results revealed that users with more followers make fewer errors, and that more errors are made during the evening and night.\nTakeaways # if spelling rules are relatively easy to grasp 2, but many errors in writing homophones are made anyway, it might mean that these errors come from ‚Äúthe nature of cognitive processes underlying the spelling process, rather than negligence or laziness.‚Äù writers often decide how to write a verb form based on their mental lexicons instead of applying spelling forms ‚Äì and it can cause problems when writers use homophones and their spelling choices are ‚Äúonly based on sound-spelling correspondence, not taking the grammatical function of the verb form into account.‚Äù the choice between the computational procedure (i.e. applying rules) vs. the retrieval procedure (i.e. using mental models) depends on which one is faster tweets are good for studying spontaneous writing, since Twitter is used by people from various population groups in terms of age and education, who don‚Äôt think too long about what they write the overall percentage of mistakes was 6.8%. In reality it‚Äôs expected to be even higher, since pseudo-homophones (non-existent words created by illegal spellings) weren‚Äôt considered in this study \u0026amp; many users tweet from smartphones, which means that autocorrection might have corrected some of the errors. Still, the 6.8% is significantly lower than 25% found in another study by Sandra (2010) 3 Quotes # Previous experimental work on Dutch and French showed that when a single pronunciation is spelled differently depending on its grammatical function, the spelling process of the correct form can be impeded (e.g., Sandra \u0026amp; Fayol 2003). 4\nA study by Hutto, Yardi, and Gilbert (2013) 5 showed that Twitter users seek out well-written content over poorly written content when deciding whether to follow another user. As people with better general language skills tend to be better spellers, we expect that the higher the number of followers, the fewer mistakes in spelling.\nSeveral explanations can be given for this pattern. First, it can be a matter of prestige. Having many followers means that tweets are judged by many people, on the basis of content but also spelling. This could mean that twitterers are more cautious and perhaps more often double-check the spelling of their tweets when they have more followers. A second possibility is that people with many followers tend to have better language skills (including spelling) in general. When someone is talented in writing, people better like what they write, resulting in more followers.\nQuestions # What factors contribute to low linguistic complexity, aside from morphographic spelling rules? What internet slang exists in Dutch? How ‚ÄúTwitter Dutch‚Äù differs from Standard Dutch / Central Dutch dialect? How does forced short format (140 / 280 characters) affect spontaneous writing? After the demise of Twitter, which platforms can provide similarly rich material for spontaneous writing research? Do mental models influence spelling errors less in languages with less pronounced sound-spelling correspondence (e.g. Chinese)?

Tearfulness often precedes or accompanies such emotional outburst. In addition to these emotional symptoms, mild physiological symptoms similar to those seen in a panic attack, such as palpitations, dizziness, trembling and so on, may appear. Immediately after this emotional outburst, distressing trains of thought or images related to recent or past unpleasant events are experienced and ruminated on repeatedly. They are often manifested as flashbacks with or without visual images. Since these conditions are the bitterest experiences for most patients, they may cope with them in various ways such as deliberate self-harm. These patients generally have a more or less depressive mood. These conditions are considerably different from a panic attack, in that the emotional and cognitive storm dominates the physical one. The author named this condition as an Anxious-Depressive Attack (ADA). In this study, we present five cases of ADA and discuss their psychopathology and differential diagnoses. To the author‚Äôs knowledge, this is the first report proposing the term ADA, which is a unique but common syndrome. Awareness regarding ADA may help improve understanding and treatment of the patient.\nTitle: Anxious-Depressive Attack: An Overlooked Condition. A Case Report\nAuthor: Hisanobu Kaiya\nURL: https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsad/8/1/8_22/_article\nDate: 2016\nFound thanks to Do You Have Sad Attacks, Too? - by Jesse Meadows - Sluggish.\nI don‚Äôt really have anything to say about these cases, except for additionally highlighting one detail: at least 2/5 participants thought that their extreme emotional experiences were normal. ‚ÄúEveryone experiences that‚Äù, ‚Äúthis is a part of my personality‚Äù‚Ä¶\nI think there‚Äôs no specific term for this phenomenon ‚Äì though I see such cases a lot while reading about autistic people‚Äôs experiences ‚Äì that I had to come up with something of my own so I can collect relevant posts under one tag. For now, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúProjection Bias (in context of extreme negative experiences)‚Äù, but I‚Äôd prefer to invent something shorter eventually.\n‚Ä¶and yeah, I had those. Such a shitty experience, and one of the worst parts is how uncontrollable these are.\nIn all the cases reported here, it was common for the ADA to appear spontaneously, irrespective of self-will. ADAs always began with an emotional outburst, followed by unpleasant memory intrusion, and finally, coping behaviors. [‚Ä¶] In most cases, the emotional outburst is followed or accompanied by weeping. Furthermore, ADAs occur suddenly without any identifiable psychological trigger.\nAnother important idea is that ‚Äúan ADA primarily concerns troubles related to interpersonal relationships.‚Äù More recent studies by Hisanobu Kaiya explore this idea even further:\nA previous study showed that patients with ADA were more socially anxious and more depressive than those without ADA, regardless of their diagnoses. Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of such disorders with a high prevalence of ADA (44.4%). According to clinical reports, patients with SAD appear hypersensitive to rejection or criticism. 1\nInterestingly, future ADA research could be the key to treatment-resistant depression:\nDepression comorbid with anxiety is often treatment-resistant where anxious-depressive attack (ADA) often lurks. [‚Ä¶] As the basic psychopathology of ADA, rejection sensitivity (RS) was revealed by a structural equation model. It is said that the presence of RS in depressive disorders implies a poor prognosis. [‚Ä¶] Manipulation of the Œº-opioid receptor function together with the DRD4 function may culminate in a treatment for RS, which could contribute to the development of a treatment for TRD via the improvement of ADA. 2\nI wonder whether this research would benefit from considering not only rejection sensitivity, but also cPTSD:\nComplex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD, cPTSD, or hyphenated C-PTSD) is a stress-related mental disorder generally occurring in response to complex traumas (i.e., commonly prolonged or repetitive exposure to a traumatic event (or traumatic events), from which one sees little or no chance to escape). 3\nOn the somewhat related note, the article‚Äôs description of ataque de nervios seems to be rather similar to traumatic grief. Wish I could run some kind of automated term analysis to determine how much these terms actually overlap.\nAtaque de nervios (attack of nerves) a syndrome among individuals of Latino descent, is characterized by symptoms of intense emotional upset, including acute anxiety, anger, or grief; screaming and shouting uncontrollably; attacks of crying; trembling; heat in the chest rising into the head; and becoming verbally and physically aggressive. Dissociative experiences (e.g., depersonalization, derealization, and amnesia), seizure-like or fainting episodes, and suicidal gestures are prominent in some ataques but absent in others. A general feature of an ataque de nervios is a sense of being out of control. Attacks frequently occur as a direct result of a stressful event related to the family, such as news of the death of a close relative, conflicts with a spouse or children, or witnessing an accident involving a family member.\nTraumatic grief or complicated mourning where trauma and grief coincide. There are conceptual links between trauma and bereavement since loss of a loved one is inherently traumatic. If a traumatic event was life-threatening, but did not result in a death, then it is more likely that the survivor will experience post-traumatic stress symptoms. If a person dies, and the survivor was close to the person who died, then it is more likely that symptoms of grief will also develop. When the death is of a loved one, and was sudden or violent, then both symptoms often coincide. 3\nWhile differential diagnostics is important, I can‚Äôt help but think about a study on how fragmented psychology has become with thousands of new methods, measures and concepts published every year only for the most of them to never be reused outside of the original study. 4 It doesn‚Äôt seem like the term ‚Äúanxious-depressive attack‚Äù was widely adopted, and I can only wonder ‚Äì what even makes contemporary psychological studies influential?\nSources # Anvari, Farid, Taym Alsalti, Lorenz Oehler, et al. ‚ÄòA Fragmented Field: Construct and Measure Proliferation in Psychology‚Äô.

Title: Growth mindset and mathematics: A bibliometric analysis\nAuthor: Chukwuemeka Metu, Jos√© Maria Marb√°n, Estefan√≠a Espina\nURL: https://journals2.ums.ac.id/jramathedu/article/view/6482\nDate: 2025-01\nLicense: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License\nA growth mindset is the belief that one\u0026rsquo;s intellect and abilities may develop through effort. This mindset suggests that intelligence is not fixed but adaptable. With the continuous growth in literature on the growth mindset in mathematics, there is a need to investigate the current trends from a bibliometric perspective. To meet this need, the leading countries, source citations, author co-citations, and word co-occurrences were examined. A total of 317 articles were retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases spanning 2014‚Äì2023. The VOSviewer software was used to analyze the collected data. The United States was the leading contributor to growth mindset research, Frontiers in Psychology emerged as the major source of citations, with Dweck being the most cited author. The word cooccurrence map was grouped into different clusters. The Scopus database shows how belief systems shape mindsets and how motivation intersects with clinical and longitudinal investigations. WoS emphasizes the importance of interventions that narrow belief-achievement gaps, as well as the role of technology. These findings offer valuable insights into the expanding body of research on growth mindset in mathematics, paving the way for further research to explore interventions, cultural influences, and long-term effects on student outcomes.\nI‚Äôm not an educator so take my words with a grain of salt, but it seems like this article could be used in a curriculum as an example of bibliometric analysis.

It‚Äôs like that on purpose: I have plenty of ideas, and I don‚Äôt want to create a false impression of ‚Äúdoing too much at once‚Äù because my potential projects got mixed up with stuff that I actively work on. The user has to make at least somewhat conscious choice: ‚ÄúYes, I want to learn more about Ideas, and I don‚Äôt expect that these were already brought to life by Cuprum Buddy‚Äù.\nThree main categories (Finished, In Progress, Ideas) are pretty straightforward and refer to a state of a project. ‚ÄúNever-ending‚Äù projects are similar to Wikipedia‚Äôs dynamic lists ‚Äì I don‚Äôt expect them to ever be fully completed.

It wasn\u0026rsquo;t my first decision of this kind, but the last time I drew something was back in 2022, so it probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t change much anyway.\nThis time I used one of Pedro Medeiros\u0026rsquo; Pixel Art Articles, namely 1 - An Absolute Beginner\u0026rsquo;s Guide. The first exercise (aside from getting Aseprite running) was to draw a mug, a sword, a skull \u0026amp; a human face before the basics were explained.\nThe Mug # Pedro Medeiros suggested to use ARQ4 palette, but Libresprite didn\u0026rsquo;t have an built-in one, so I used monokai instead. It turned out kinda weird in terms of both shape and colour choices \u0026ndash; I wonder what it will look like if I redraw it after a few more months of practice.\nThe Sword # At this moment I stopped trying to use a specific palette (though I chose a different preset for each of these three images). This one is an attempt to draw an RPG Maker-esque icon without a reference. I think it could have worked as it is for certain artstyles, but I wish I knew how to make it more detailed.\nThe Skull # Probably the easiest drawing from this batch. Literally draw a circle for the head, draw a rectangle for the chin, add some details, and you\u0026rsquo;re good to go.\nThe Human Face # This one was the most difficult to create. I tried to draw it exactly as I drew the skull, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the result. For example, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to do with this person\u0026rsquo;s mouth, so I drew a mask just not to think about it for too long.\n","date":"July 19, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/moments/2025-07-19-learning-pixel-art/","section":"Moments","summary":"","title":"2025-07-19: Learning Pixel Art","type":"moments"},{"content":"","date":"July 19, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/digital-art/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Digital Art","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"July 19, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pixel-art/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pixel Art","type":"tags"},{"content":" By Toby Hudson - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, Link\nEntity Explosion (Q98398855) is a Chrome and Firefox browser extension by Toby Hudson (99of9) which uses API calls to the Wikidata Query Service to match the URL you are browsing on to a Wikidata item, and then display Wikidata data and links.\nTitle: Entity Explosion\nAuthor: Toby Hudson\nURL: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Entity_Explosion\nLicense: GPL-3.0 license\nI would say that results provided by this extension aren\u0026rsquo;t always going to be what you expect, but even these mismatches can be entertaining in their own regard.\nFor example, for now-deleted post from r/todayilearned (by the way, I highly recommend it as a source of daily random interesting facts) about \u0026ldquo;Conan the Bacterium\u0026rdquo; Entity Explosion returns:\nTIL about \u0026quot;Conan the Bacterium\u0026quot;, an organism that's been around for about a billion years more than us, can survive almost anything and will likely outlast us all.\nby u/1Universal_Turtle in todayilearned\nExplosion Entity screenshot showing \u0026lsquo;fact\u0026rsquo;-related links And for the Wikipedia page about \u0026ldquo;Conan the Bacterium\u0026rdquo; (which has a funny name in Latin as well, meaning \u0026ldquo;radiation-surviving terrible berry\u0026rdquo;), the extension predictably returns correct results, since Wikipedia-based projects are deeply interconnected.\nExplosion Entity screenshot showing \u0026lsquo;Deinococcus radiodurans\u0026rsquo;-related links Overall, I think it\u0026rsquo;s a nice extension.

If you dislike any of the artists, feel free to skip their section. For Vocaloid \u0026amp; voice synth in general the producer comes before the voice package they used.

I‚Äôve learnt a lot during this period (which was quite emotionally intense) both about myself and the ways to teach myself. However, spending so much time preparing for exams intended for high schoolers isn‚Äôt the most exciting nor career-improving way to live my life.\nJune‚Äô25: The Beginning # Around the same time I‚Äôve also decided to reread ‚ÄúUltralearning‚Äù by Scott Young and, I believe, it was the exact kind of luck that can be called ‚Äúserendipity‚Äù. The thing is: Scott Young, among other things, got famous because he managed to finish the 4-year MIT Computer Science program in just one year.\nI‚Äôm no Scott Young, so I don‚Äôt even bother trying to fit four years of studying into one. However, I realized that this is my chance to prepare for university to achieve two goals at the same time:\npassing my exams (I need at least 60/100 ‚Äì the more the better, ovviamente) studying at least some first-year subjects before actually enrolling to make my university years a bit easier and to get some actually useful non-exam-related knowledge. Of course, my goals directly affected the ‚Äúprograms‚Äù I chose for this experiment:\nComputer Science degree by Open Source Society University Biology course by –ù–û–û (taught in Russian) Math textbooks by OpenStax (recommended in the ‚ÄúReadings‚Äù from Open Source Society University‚Äôs Pre-college math) Another important change was that I‚Äôve stopped trying to do everything that I think has to be done. In July-October 2024 I tried to ‚Äúget it right from the start‚Äù: solve all the ~160-200 test questions and write answers for ~10 open questions, watch 2 lectures and 2 practice sessions, take notes, make Anki cards‚Ä¶ And that was just biology, leaving me almost no time and energy for other subjects nor fulfilling rest.\nI feel like I still haven‚Äôt overcome the resulting burnout, therefore for the first time in my learning practice I‚Äôve decided to focus not on grinding study-dedicated hours every single day, but on following the schedule. All I have to do is to watch six lectures per week, no matter how many hours it takes or whether I‚Äôm able to do homework. Obviously, it would be better to have more practical self-assignment, ask more questions, read extra sources, etc. etc., but I just can‚Äôt anymore.\nTherefore the overall approach is more passive, but it‚Äôs better than nothing. At the very least I‚Äôll get neural connections; it‚Äôs way easier to learn something new from ‚Äúaha, I‚Äôve already heard about that somewhere‚Äù than from the scratch.\nAnother thing worth mentioning is a study technique called interleaving. Interleaving is about not studying only one subject at a time, but rotating subjects. Given that I happen to dislike daily streaks (these are wayyyy too restrictive), it feels nice to change things that I work on from time to time. In my case, rotation happens on daily basis: math-bio-CS, math-bio-CS, day off.\nJuly‚Äô25: The Heatwave # In summer of 2025 Europe was struck by an intense heatwave which took lives across several countries. Only looking at 35¬∞C (95¬∞F) heat prediction in my weather app I‚Äôve realized that I indeed live not so far from Europe. Well, not this far to be not affected by global climate change anyway.\nIt certainly didn‚Äôt help that my anti-migraine meds make me more vulnerable to high temperatures, forcing me to take a week and a half break. My brain felt like it‚Äôs melting, the fatigue and dehydration also felt worse than usual.\nAnd you know what? I needed a break anyway, and the heatwave allowed me to explore my other interests like music and pixel art. Moreover, I believe that in long-term projects like this one being able to return after a break is more important than to work on the same project every single day.\n(that‚Äôs why I dislike daily streaks ‚Äì they don‚Äôt work for me!)\nAnother important thing was that I finally kinda got my shit together. My partner suggested to abandon my idea of getting into university and to study by myself and get a job ‚Äì but this path was unclear to me despite tons of instructions on how to get into data science in 202X.\nOSSU self-taught Computer Science degree inspired me to create my own curriculum, and it feels so liberating to realize that I can choose literally anything I want. Even Haskell, even category theory, even psychology of insight ‚Äì all these shiny distractions have become a part of the curriculum. And it‚Äôs totally fine as long as I stick to the plan and take one course at a time instead of ten.\nStudy Report: July‚Äò2025 # Course Intended Result Actual Result Things to Improve Pre-algebra by OpenStax To cover 8 topics:\n1.1 Introduction to Whole Numbers 1.2 Add Whole Numbers 1.3 Subtract Whole Numbers 1.4 Multiply Whole Numbers 1.5 Divide Whole Numbers\n2.1 Use the Language of Algebra\n2.2 Evaluate, Simplify, and Translate Expressions 2.3 Solving Equations Using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality Covered 2 chapters (10 topics):\n1.1 Introduction to Whole Numbers 1.2 Add Whole Numbers 1.3 Subtract Whole Numbers 1.4 Multiply Whole Numbers 1.5 Divide Whole Numbers\n2.1 Use the Language of Algebra\n2.2 Evaluate, Simplify, and Translate Expressions 2.3 Solving Equations Using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality\n2.4 Find Multiples and Factors 2.5 Prime Factorization and the Least Common Multiple This textbook is too slow for me, which makes studying somewhat boring.

I also tried switching from pre-algebra to calculus, but couldn‚Äôt make myself study past the first subchapter (?) of chapter 1. While studying pre-algebra is mostly about review of, honestly, basic concepts, studying calculus intensifies overall perceived difficulty and increases friction. At a university I wouldn‚Äôt have a choice what \u0026amp; when I need to study, but in self-paced environment I constantly have to solve motivation issues while dealing with burnout and chronic exhaustion.

You were warned.\nRecently I have watched a video by Patricia Taxxon about DHMIS unintentionally representing Patricia‚Äôs own experience as early-diagnosed and mistreated autistic child.\nAmong other things, Patricia describes the the 6th episode reveal of the mastermind behind all these malevolent teachers pestering the protagonists as disappointing: in Patricia‚Äôs opinion, the show could have been scarier if the teachers in question weren‚Äôt merely controlled by a bunch of buttons, but instead actually represented figures who have power on child‚Äôs life ‚Äì yet are absolutely unreliable. Just like in the ‚ÄúSex House‚Äù, a fake reality show where contestants rely on show-runners, yet the latter don‚Äôt understand a thing about how to create a successful reality show and what makes people want sex in the first place. Things go downhill extremely quickly, and ‚Äúreality show‚Äù essentially turns into thriller (including an accidental murder of a person tied in a room full of mold).\nIt really made me think of the Incompetence Horror as a genre. The closest trope to it is probably Lethally Stupid, when character‚Äôs not so thought through decisions put anyone else‚Äôs life in danger. There‚Äôs also Lethal Negligence, but it seems like ‚Äúlethal negligence‚Äù is intentional, while ‚Äúlethal stupidity‚Äù isn‚Äôt.

It‚Äôs a pity that I didn‚Äôt start recording my walkthrough right away. Not that I have any equipment for that, but you never know when the time to become a youtuber might come.\n‚ÄúBlue Prince‚Äù is a game about a young heir who must pass the trial to become the next owner of Mt. Holly mansion. The task is to find the secret 46th room in 45-room mansion ‚Äúin a timely manner‚Äù, but keep in mind: every single day the house map changes.\nThat‚Äôs it. The player has an unknown number of days to find 46th room, and every day the house resets, allowing the player to build their path anew using blueprints.\nDrafting (i.e. selecting the next room) in ‚ÄúBlue Prince‚Äù, screenshot from Steam (‚ÄúBlue Prince‚Äù ‚Üí blueprints. Good one.)\nAlmost every time the player opens a new door, there is a choice: one of these three blueprints will become the part of the journey. Choosing one of these rooms is called ‚Äúdrafting‚Äù. However, some doors are closed either with a key or a keycard and need to be opened before the player can draft the next room; some rooms cost from one to five gems to draft. Therefore there‚Äôs nothing too surprising if the player ends up soft-locking themselves without ever reaching the antechamber.\nMoreover, the number of available actions during the day is also limited by ‚Äústeps‚Äù. Usually the player spends their steps by moving between rooms, though there are several ‚Äúinvisible doors‚Äù outside of the mansion as well. If the player runs out of steps, they will be forced to start the next in-game day, as staying in the mansion overnight is prohibited.\nThe mansion itself is filled with riddles. In the beginning of the game ‚ÄúBlue Prince‚Äù itself recommends keeping a journal, and my partner and I have written around ten pages by now.\nThe impression # ‚Ä¶turned out to be way more difficult to pinpoint than I thought. While playing ‚ÄúBlue Prince‚Äù I experience an emotional roller coaster: pure joy from discovering new rooms, items and strategies, confusion and ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments when solving puzzles, even wordless shock when another game session is over and I realize how much progress I made during this run.\n","date":"April 29, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sources/blue-prince-dogubomb/","section":"Sources","summary":"","title":"üéÆ Blue Prince„ÄàDogubomb„Äâ","type":"sources"},{"content":"","date":"April 29, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/hyperfixation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hyperfixation","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"April 29, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/investigative-reading-material/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Investigative Reading Material","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"April 29, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/maps/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Maps","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"April 29, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/puns/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Puns","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"April 29, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/resource-management/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Resource Management","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"April 29, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/roguelite/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Roguelite","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"April 29, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/strategy-game/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Strategy Game","type":"tags"},{"content":" Introduction # ‚ÄúWhat I Know About: The Series‚Äù (WIKA for short) is a set of post sequences which tackle some subject in textbook-like fashion. It‚Äôs different from ‚ÄúResearch‚Äù category, since it doesn‚Äôt revolve about any specific research questions and doesn‚Äôt aim to create any new knowledge.\nEven during my high school years I have noticed that I don‚Äôt like taking notes. I thought the reason was my bad handwriting, but the issue remained the same both when I studied at the university and when I left it. I could spend hours making these notes, and I never re-read them. In some cases I didn‚Äôt even read the material before writing it in my notebook or copy-pasting it in Word, Typst, Obsidian‚Ä¶\nMuch later I have realized that I don‚Äôt like notes for the same reason why I didn‚Äôt like playing with dolls in kindergarten and why speaking to a rubber ducky toy doesn‚Äôt work for me as good as it reportedly does for other.\nNeither dolls, rubber ducks nor notes talk to me. While I can imagine some response, I‚Äôm restricted by my own life experiences and boundaries of what is even imaginable to me. Talking to others allows me to learn more break these boundaries and get at least a glimpse of what not-my life might look like; what kinds of questions, expectations and answers can non-my experiences provide. And while I know I‚Äôm not obliged to publish my notes, having a particular audience in mind significantly affects both my motivation and writing style.\nTherefore, the primary goal of WIKA is to make learning from textbooks more enjoyable via enabling me to share the results of my studies and improve them during discussions with my readers. I‚Äôm going to compare different textbooks \u0026amp; other sources and their explanation approaches, while trying to create comprehensive, yet multi-faceted notes.\nAn unexpected side-effect of this approach is that now I‚Äôm way more willing to try study techniques that, I thought, required ‚Äútoo much effort‚Äù.\nFor example, there‚Äôs an active recall technique that requires to take an empty piece of paper, write down everything you remember about the topic and then compare your notes with the original source of that knowledge (textbook, lecture, video, etc.) It turned out that I already have very similar workflow when writing my blog posts: I write down everything I want to say and then I check whether I cited the source correctly (and sometimes even discarding the idea of the post in the process because misunderstanding was too huge and the whole argumentation fell apart because of it!).\nWhat I Know About: The List # [empty for now]\n","date":"April 22, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/what-i-know-about-the-series/","section":"","summary":"","title":"What I Know About: The Series","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"April 22, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/category-theory/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Category Theory","type":"tags"},{"content":" Five lemma commutative diagram by IkamusumeFan In mathematics, and especially in category theory, a commutative diagram is a diagram such that all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result.

I tend not to re-read notes which I wrote for myself. On the one hand, it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat understandable with handwritten notes, since I dislike my handwriting, \u0026ndash; however, the issue persists even when I write Obsidian notes on my laptop. On the other hand, I\u0026rsquo;m way more likely to write something down and then revise \u0026amp; edit it if I write for a blog, giving myself the ability to show my work to the world and gaining the possibility of improving my work even further with readers\u0026rsquo; feedback Eventually I lost any motivation to write in my telegram channel, since there were almost no comments. Even before that I oftentimes felt that I\u0026rsquo;m talking to myself standing on a stage in an empty concert hall \u0026ndash; for two years in row I think we can call the general pattern \u0026ldquo;I prefer to do things with/for the others instead of doing them for/by myself\u0026rdquo;. This has several consequences, e.g.¬†loss of motivation if it turns out that my work was never really needed in the first place. Being autistic, I also tend to overshoot the goal, while my neurotypical peers can\u0026rsquo;t understand why I even worry so much.\nSide note: I can\u0026rsquo;t stop thinking about these quotes from Devon Price\u0026rsquo;s blogpost \u0026ldquo;How Society Forces Autistics to Become Inhibited \u0026amp; Passive\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026ldquo;Was I told sometimes to settle down and get used to how the world is?\u0026rdquo; Eric says. \u0026ldquo;Absolutely, I was. But more often, I would deliver an impassioned speech about my political beliefs or ask if I could wear my sunglasses indoors, and I\u0026rsquo;d just get this blank stare. Like I had not said anything.\u0026rdquo;\nBeing reprimanded for harmless awkwardness really stays with you. I\u0026rsquo;ve never forgotten the fury that Looney Tunes quote had earned me. But I also remember the far more intense and debilitating experience of being completely frozen out. When neuro-conforming people absolutely cannot stand what you have to say, their faces go vacant and they don\u0026rsquo;t even respond. It\u0026rsquo;s even more chilling than being told you\u0026rsquo;re saying something bad.\nEric says, \u0026ldquo;With my gay earrings and my stimming and my outspoken political views I was trying to say see me, see who I am, and everyone would just look past.\u0026rdquo;\nI also have similar experiences, though I wasn\u0026rsquo;t openly contrarian during my childhood.\nIt feels extremely lonely to \u0026ldquo;be seen\u0026rdquo; for completely minuscule things like that I\u0026rsquo;m left-handed, have more than ten tabs open in my browser simultaneously, what I eat, how much time I spend in socials, etc., etc. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard all these unwanted comments so many times from sort many people that I wonder whether there\u0026rsquo;s a hub providing people with all these tasteless comments.\nWhat I wasn\u0026rsquo;t being seen for were my interests. I remember the empty faces of my relatives, classmaam s, so-called friends when I tried to tell them what exactly keeps me going; I remember the silence in return. It got so bad that the best working method of connecting with others was oversharing about my trauma. Then the empathy resources of the others eventually got depleted, and I was all alone again, still completely unseen for who I am as my trauma became my public identity.\nPerhaps the most chilling thing is that in my experience it seems that these empty stares weren\u0026rsquo;t caused by neurotype differences. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard that specific silence both from neurotypical AND autistic people.\nI still don\u0026rsquo;t understand why can\u0026rsquo;t they ask when I\u0026rsquo;m trying to be sarcastic and then actually say something offensive. I still don\u0026rsquo;t understand so many things that it\u0026rsquo;s way easier to continue hiding that to show how vulnerable I am.\nBut I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hide anymore. Don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose the chance of meeting someone who will like me the way I am just because too many people didn\u0026rsquo;t. Don\u0026rsquo;t want to once again forget what makes my eyes sparkle just because no one else cared.\nIn July 2025 I realised that actually I can write for a one particular person if I need someone this much: namely, my partner. I can always show him work, and more-than-often it leads to quite awesome discoveries about our common interests. I finally feel accepted for who I am. If anyone else likes my work \u0026ndash; cool! I just won\u0026rsquo;t count on it by default.\n","date":"April 22, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/musings/the-need-of-response/","section":"Musings","summary":"","title":"The Need of Response","type":"musings"},{"content":" Title: Vectors, what even are they?\nAuthor: Grant Sanderson\nURL: https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/vectors (YouTube video + transcript)\nDate: 2016-08-06 (published), 2025-03-13 (updated)\nLicense: ‚ÄúUnder the standard YouTube license, you are free to embed the videos in your own site or blog, as long as it is not behind a paywall. In both cases, attribution is of course appreciated‚Äù. (from FAQ)\nThis post turned out to be more personal that I expected. I didn‚Äôt try to retell Grant‚Äôs video nor take notes from it: I believe the transcript does both of these jobs good enough. Therefore expect to read a bunch of anecdotes with occasional references to other mathematical fields, terms, etc.\nWhat I found interesting is three different definitions of a vector: I don‚Äôt have much experience with linear algebra, but for some reason I‚Äôm used to one vector definition at a time. To be more precise, I vaguely remember ‚Äúvector is a directed line segment‚Äù from high school. (In this video it‚Äôs called ‚Äúphysics student perspective‚Äù, i.e. ‚Äúarrows pointing in space‚Äù (c).)\nThat‚Äôs why I was surprised to learn that matrices are vectors and vice versa ‚Äì for some reason I prefer matrices over vectors.\nAnyways, this brings us to the mathematician‚Äôs perspective ‚Äì physics student perspective plus computer science perspective ‚Äòwhere \u0026ldquo;vector\u0026rdquo; is pretty much a fancy word for list‚Äô. It‚Äôs worth noting that the mathematician‚Äôs definition is an example of Yoneda lemma:\n[A] vector can be anything where there\u0026rsquo;s a sensible notion of adding two vectors and multiplying a vector by a number, operations that we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about later in this chapter.\nFor reference, Yoneda lemma, simply put, states that to describe an object one needs to describe all its relationships with other objects. (Yep, it‚Äôs ‚Äúreferencing category theory concepts while studying way simpler subjects‚Äù time.)\nAnother explanation that caught my eye was:\nWhenever you catch a number like \\(2\\), \\(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\)‚Äã, or \\(‚àí1.5\\) acting like this, scaling some vector [during multiplication and division by number operations, making the resulting vector shorter, longer, or changing its direction to the opposite one], you call it a \u0026ldquo;scalar\u0026rdquo;. In fact, throughout linear algebra, one of the main things numbers do is scale vectors, so it\u0026rsquo;s common to use the word scalar interchangeably with the word number.\nTo give another definition:\nScalar quantities or simply scalars are physical quantities that can be described by a single pure number (a scalar, typically a real number), accompanied by a unit of measurement, as in \u0026ldquo;10¬†cm\u0026rdquo; (ten centimeters). \u0026lt;‚Ä¶\u0026gt; Scalars do not represent a direction.\n‚Äì Scalar (physics) (Wikipedia)\nI absolutely adore how reading Wikipedia can help to discover unexpected connections between ideas. I thought ‚Äúoh, how interesting to define a vector as scaling thing in the first sentence and as just a number only in a second one‚Äù, and then I saw this:\nThe term \u0026ldquo;scalar\u0026rdquo; has origin in the multiplication of vectors by a unitless scalar, which is a uniform scaling transformation.\n‚Äì Scalar (physics) (Wikipedia)\nSo scalar really started as a ‚Äúthing which scales other things‚Äù in the first place and ‚Äújust a number‚Äù in the second.\n","date":"April 20, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sources/linear-algebra---vectors-what-even-are-they-3blue1brown/","section":"Sources","summary":"","title":"üé• Linear Algebra: Vectors, what even are they?„Äà3blue1brown„Äâ","type":"sources"},{"content":"","date":"April 20, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/linear-algebra/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Linear Algebra","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"April 20, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/scalars/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Scalars","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"April 20, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/vectors/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Vectors","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"April 20, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/what-i-know-about-linear-algebra-sources/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"What I Know About Linear Algebra: Sources","type":"series"},{"content":" Keep the Rhythm screenshot from Keep the Rhythm\u0026rsquo;s repository by Benjamin Ezequiel Keep the Rhythm is an Obsidian plugin that helps you maintain a consistent writing practice by tracking your daily word count and visualizing it through an elegant heatmap.\nTitle: Keep the Rhythm\nAuthor: Benjamin Ezequiel\nURL: https://github.com/benjaminezequiel/keep-the-rhythm/\nDate: 2024-12-27 (created), 2025-02-22 (latest release)\nLicense: MIT\nThanks to obsi hub for sharing this plugin! 1\nNotes:\nIf you erase words, your word count will go down, which can severely demotivate editing your work if you are more motivated by the amount of words than the actual quality of writing.

The last time I participated was in ~2018, and I thought it would be a good idea to write a bunch of blog post drafts as a challenge. Given that on March 31st, 2025, there was an announcement that NaNoWriMo shuts down due to lack of sponsors, it might be my very last opportunity to ‚Äúformally‚Äù participate.\nFirst of all, for some reason I didn‚Äôt expect the change of NaNoWriMo‚Äôs site layout. I actually postponed the start of a challenge for a day, because late in the evening I couldn‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt create an April 2025 Camp NaNoWriMo project. As far as I understand, this is actually by design and I should have signed up for Camp in March to be able to join it. I didn‚Äôt let that stop me, and started an ‚Äúindependent‚Äù (i.e. not attached to the ongoing challenge) project.\nIt turned out that the timing wasn‚Äôt the best either. I have unknowingly strained my back in the late March (more about it at 2025-03-XX Make Sure to Warm Up Beforehand), and during the first week of April I couldn‚Äôt walk or even sit much because of the pain. Less walking, among other things, means less experiences and less material to write about, not to mention that I had less energy for writing as my body slowly recovered.\nAnother mistake was to hope to produce high-effort posts during NaNoWriMo. I went by the rules of the main November challenge ‚Äì produce 50,000 words within a month with little to no editing so the participant‚Äôs creativity can flow freely without stumbling upon shame and other obstacles ‚Äì despite Camp rules allowing to do almost anything you want and how much you want from writing to editing as long as you produce enough words per day.\nAnd while sometimes I produced my own writing, during a few especially bad days I had to literally farm the word count by creating new pages and inserting Obsidian templates and quotes from Wikipedia. To be clear, NaNoWriMo encourages cheating as long as you keep writing, and I was going to create all these pages anyway, but over-relying on this significantly hurt my satisfaction with my own work.\nA few examples of cheating methods (keep in mind that NaNoWriMo‚Äôs goal is to write a novel, not a bunch of blog posts):\nChandler\u0026rsquo;s Law:\n\u0026ldquo;If all else fails, have a band of ninjas attack somebody\u0026rdquo; is official advice for writers at a loss for material to further their novel\u0026rsquo;s word count. Or Mr. Ian Woon (which is an anagram of \u0026ldquo;NaNoWriMo\u0026rdquo;). Or The Traveling Shovel of Death. Or a Trebuchet. Or drown someone in ketchup. ‚Äì NaNoWriMo ¬ª Media Notes (TVTropes)\nHowever, it isn‚Äôt all that dire. As I write, I constantly generate feedback for myself. Do I need more plugins outside of those mentioned in colophon to make the process smoother? Which topics even come to my mind when I have to write about literally anything?\nTurns out that I tend to write posts about media that impressed me as short-forms and study notes on obscure (at least for a general audience) nerdy topics such as Haskell or accessing RSS feeds via Elfeed in DOOM Emacs. About which, to be honest, I wanted to write for a long time, but I felt that nobody would be interested in reading my Telegram blog if I wrote about these.\n(this is pretty weird, since I know for sure that at least some of my readers work in IT and actually know way more than I do. huh)\n2025-04-30: The End # Today is the last day of the challenge, and I‚Äôm spent. A few lessons:\nI was doing rather fine until I switched platforms from Quartz to Hugo and Blowfish, while Hugo and Blowfish weren‚Äôt even compatible because of then-recent Hugo updates. For a few days I was literally paralyzed, as I didn‚Äôt want to write for Quartz only to have more posts to adapt to Hugo later. I didn‚Äôt install any other already working theme for Hugo; I tried to make Blowfish work, and it took way more effort than I expected. Both Hugo‚Äôs and Blowfish‚Äô documentation were confusing at times, and some of Hugo‚Äôs features don‚Äôt work in Blowfish or work differently. For example, Hugo supports both LaTeX and KaTeX, Blowfish supports KaTeX only, and Obsidian plugins are made almost exclusively for LaTeX, creating the need to convert LaTeX to KaTeX before publishing any math-containing page. I was writing or fixing my site without any days off, which eventually caused a minor migraine episode. While no serious harm was done, I suspect that the whole ‚Äúdo something every single day without breaks!‚Äù format simply isn‚Äôt for me, no matter whether it‚Äôs about blogging, studying, etc. I was spending too much time on my laptop, and to have some rest I was‚Ä¶ scrolling on my phone. By the end of the day my eyes were dry and my brain was melting, logically inspiring me to restrict my phone usage. This time I didn‚Äôt dedicate a separate ‚Äúday without gadgets‚Äù: I stopped using my phone while I‚Äôm at home whatsoever, except for few cases when I need to use it (no, the urge to scroll doesn‚Äôt count). Fortunately, summer is coming, so I will be able to go outside, sit on a bench in the nearest park and scroll all the time I want ‚Äì but still, definitely not from home. WRITING TAKES EFFORT. During the last few months of writing for my Telegram blog I got used to low-effort, more slice-of-lifey posts which I could get out of my head in 20-40 minutes. More niche, detailed and better-researched didn‚Äôt get the same amount of attention, and that‚Äôs why eventually I stopped writing them at all ‚Äì and it was suffocating many posts about things that make my eyes shine, robbing me of any desire to blog at all. However, returning to at least middle-effort posts wasn‚Äôt easy ‚Äì but I want to be the person who can do difficult things, so here I am and here is my WIKA project. While I didn‚Äôt make it to 50,000 words, this NaNo is the first one which I actually finished. Until that my best streak was 18 days, but way more often I dropped the challenge during the first week. And hey, now I actually have my own site with some cool built-in features like localization and embed support!\nAs always, I can‚Äôt publish everything I wrote during the challenge.

A parody of amateur adventure design, this metagame consists of a simple treasure hunting game, and a complex editor needed to complete it.

Who might have done this and that? With which probability and how soon a certain even will happen, if ever?\nThis approach somewhat disrupts the reading flow, since from time to time we burst into a lengthy discussion of whatever seemingly minor detail, ‚Äì but it also made the experience so much richer.\nThe problem is: there are too many small details to keep track of all of them. I believe some kind of (maybe AI-powered) mindmapping software could help with that: what questions were asked, when and which answers were found.\nMoreover, I feel like investigative reading a pretty cool reading club concept, because different people would have different points of view, allowing to engage with the story in a much more multi-faceted way. In particular, my partner suggested started a podcast, and I feel there will be some similarities with Vox Machina\u0026rsquo;s Dungeons and Dragons sessions: (well, at least in terms of ‚Äúthere is a somewhat stable cast with occasional guests‚Äù).\nHow I see it: each participant is assigned a role depending on whether they read the work of the day and on how much reading experience they have, ‚Äì and there‚Äôs also someone who takes notes, maybe with help of an AI speech recognition tools. Participants read the work/chapter of choice together, stopping from time to time to discuss both pre-made \u0026amp; occasional questions, using only already read part of the work of the day \u0026amp; the knowledge obtained by reading/watching/playing something else. The results of discussion are written down in a flowchart, allowing to connect questions and hypotheses with answers and actual plot points.\nThe format itself sounds pretty difficult to recreate consistently, therefore:\nIt will be better to start from smaller works; We might need to prioritize quality over quantity and/or consistency of club meetings / podcast episodes. upd 2025-08-16: for some reason for a while I thought that my partner and I came up with this idea ourselves. However, it\u0026rsquo;s not the case, and I should give credit to We want MoR \u0026amp; Not Everything Is A Clue which inspired my partner to try out this format.\n[We Want MoR] is a podcast in the style of We‚Äôve Got Worm from Doof Media (formerly The Daly Planet).

Therefore I‚Äôll leave three quote below ‚Äì please don‚Äôt forget to read the whole thing if these resonate with you.\nAt the same time, I‚Äôm careful about preaching leaving as yet another individualist fetch. We‚Äôre already isolated beyond repair into submission, where ‚Äúsetting boundaries‚Äù and ‚Äúprioritizing yourself‚Äù are just encoded absolution of guilt in turning your back away from those who need you, dividing us further into singular labor units in which we can get high and wet and horny on consumerism and excessive productivity, benefitting the top of the pyramid and leaving each other empty-handed and unstable. That‚Äôs not at all what I stand for, so let me reinstate: I don‚Äôt leave when I‚Äôm inconvenienced or when things are difficult. I leave when inconvenience turns to self-harm ‚Äî once the scale tips and the cost of staying outweighs the pain of parting ways. To leave is to remove myself from places that are hurting me, using me, hindering me ‚Äî I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an inherently capitalist idea in this capacity. In fact, I think it‚Äôs something young women should exercise more. Because, well, we‚Äôre mostly told to do the opposite.\nI could‚Äôve waited for things to get worse or better or remain the same, but now we‚Äôll never know. I wasn‚Äôt curious enough to see what happens if I just push a little harder or wait a little longer.\nI also just don‚Äôt buy into the lie that hating our circumstances is a natural part of the human condition, something to endure. No promise is lucrative enough when you have to force yourself out of bed every morning.\nMy leaving policy comes from trauma and is extreme and ruthless, near toying with morality at times, decapitating certainty at a great cost. I wouldn‚Äôt want you to live by it ‚Äî I may as well regret it all when I‚Äôm older. But since you‚Äôll have a million people tell you to remain where you are, to sacrifice, to endure, to wait it out, that your doubt is sinful and your dissatisfaction narcissistic, maybe you could use some tough love from an avoidant.\nTidGy is basically a TiddlyWiki with preinstalled plugins.

Spoilers Alert: Following post contains unmarked spoilers to all of the books in A Practical Guide to Evil. You have been warned.\nI highly recommend you to check out this work before reading further, starting at¬†https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/prologue/.\nThe story begins rather slowly, therefore I also recommend to read at least 10 chapters before deciding to drop it.\n2025-03-18 Introduction \u0026amp; Tropes # I believe that eventually this note will become one of the most entertaining to reread. I wish I\u0026rsquo;ve started writing my thoughts down (and publicly) earlier.\nIn short, \u0026ldquo;A Practical Guide to Evil\u0026rdquo; (PGtE for short) is an epic fantasy novel. Of course, this \u0026ldquo;definition\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t describe it fully.\nOne of the most peculiar things about this work is that it\u0026rsquo;s extremely long¬†‚Äì¬†600+ chapters already divided into 7 books in the web version, which might be redivided into 15 books in print¬†‚Äì¬†and knowing about PGtE length made me geniunely surprised about how¬†dynamic¬†the plot feels despite diving deeply into the world\u0026rsquo;s lore from time to time. I simply didn\u0026rsquo;t expect, given such a volume, that many plot points would be developed so early on.\nAh, I totally forgot. I\u0026rsquo;ve read 23 out of 600+ chapters by now. I bet my description will change in the future.\nAs for now, the story follows Catherine Foundling, an orphaned 16-ish years old girl, who wants to infiltrate the Empire of Praes\u0026rsquo; army to set her home kingdom of Callow free. However, for some not-very-clear-yet reason she becomes an apprentice of Black Knight¬†‚Äì¬†the very guy with eerie green eyes who had a significant role in conquering Callow in the first place.\nBy the way, Good and Evil exist and sometimes grant to those who seem worthy Names¬†‚Äì¬†way-more-than-ordinary abilities. Named people should fulfill their Roles, which are extremely similar to character archetypes and their purpose in fiction in general. Incredibly tropey stuff.\n(I wonder how reading \u0026ldquo;Morphology of the Folktale\u0026rdquo; by Vladimir Propp or \u0026ldquo;The Hero with a Thousand Faces\u0026rdquo; by Joseph Campbell would affect my future interpretations of what\u0026rsquo;s going on).\nAnother interesting thing about \u0026ldquo;A¬†Practical¬†Guide to Evil\u0026rdquo; is that it\u0026rsquo;s not very practical, compared to other¬†rational fiction¬†works, though sometimes it provides more obvious lessons similar to those found in \u0026ldquo;Evil Overlord List\u0026rdquo; (basically \u0026ldquo;Things I\u0026rsquo;ll do if I ever become an Evil Overlord\u0026rdquo; aimed to avoid numerous mistakes of fictional villains). Also it\u0026rsquo;s not a guide (i.e. an instruction manual): PGtE¬†‚Äì¬†at least so far¬†‚Äì¬†doesn\u0026rsquo;t lecture the reader.\n2025-03-22 Catherine # It should be noted that at first I didn\u0026rsquo;t care about PGtE too much. My partner begged me to read it together, and we went through the first 10 chapters or so, but then my migraine showed up once again, with headache overshadowing all my other plans.\nAfter a few months I caught myself thinking: how\u0026rsquo;s Catherine doing, given that we stopped reading right at a cliffhanger, when she is surrounded by other Name claimants and it seems to be ‚Äúkill or be killed‚Äú kind of situation?\nIt also should be noted that after the pause I was so interested that I simply couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to read with my partner (who, by the way, has already read the whole story). I\u0026rsquo;ve read about 13 chapters in a week despite me being a really slow reader.\nAdditionally, I grew fond of Catherine and started rooting for her. Smart, agentic, strong, sharp tongued orphan girl who fights for a greater essentially Good cause using the resources and knowledge of Evil. Neat! While I don\u0026rsquo;t think \u0026ldquo;Oh, this is so me\u0026rdquo;, I see a few similarities between us, and some of her qualities I\u0026rsquo;d like to foster in myself as well.\n\u0026lsquo;Do it for Catherine\u0026rsquo; meme made by me 2025-03-29 Webtoon # You can also read PGtE in a webtoon adaptation, thought it‚Äôs based on an a freshly edited, getting-prepared-to-be-printed version of the book, not the one which is available online for free.\nWhile reading the webtoon, I have noticed that if you try to open chapter 2, you‚Äôll be redirected to some other site which doesn‚Äôt even open. I believe that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsubtle‚Äù way to convince readers to either log in or create an account. Fortunately, there‚Äôs Webtoons MIM Blocker, a Firefox plugin which allows to bypass that.\nTo be honest, I prefer the book over the webtoon. While I truly adore the artstyle, the omission of many, oh so many events, thoughts, lore descriptions makes me sad. Reading the webtoon might be easier, but webtoon-only readers are going to miss soooo much.\n","date":"March 18, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sources/-a-practical-guide-to-evil-erratic-errata/","section":"Sources","summary":"","title":"üìî A Practical Guide to Evil„ÄàErratic Errata„Äâ","type":"sources"},{"content":"","date":"March 18, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/deconstruction/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Deconstruction","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"March 18, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ethics-and-moral-philosophy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ethics and Moral Philosophy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"March 18, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/fantasy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fantasy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"March 18, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/rational-fiction/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Rational Fiction","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"projects"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/the-rose-diaries/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"[\"The Rose Diaries\"]","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/creators/","section":"Creators","summary":"","title":"Creators","type":"creators"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/genres/","section":"Genres","summary":"","title":"Genres","type":"genres"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/translators/","section":"Translators","summary":"","title":"Translators","type":"translators"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/year/","section":"Year","summary":"","title":"Year","type":"year"}]
