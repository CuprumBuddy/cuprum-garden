It wasn\u0026rsquo;t my first decision of this kind, but the last time I drew something was back in 2022, so it probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t change much anyway.\nThis time I used one of Pedro Medeiros\u0026rsquo; Pixel Art Articles, namely 1 - An Absolute Beginner\u0026rsquo;s Guide. The first exercise (aside from getting Aseprite running) was to draw a mug, a sword, a skull \u0026amp; a human face before the basics were explained.\nThe Mug # Pedro Medeiros suggested to use ARQ4 palette, but Libresprite didn\u0026rsquo;t have an built-in one, so I used monokai instead. It turned out kinda weird in terms of both shape and colour choices \u0026ndash; I wonder what it will look like if I redraw it after a few more months of practice.\nThe Sword # At this moment I stopped trying to use a specific palette (though I chose a different preset for each of these three images). This one is an attempt to draw an RPG Maker-esque icon without a reference. I think it could have worked as it is for certain artstyles, but I wish I knew how to make it more detailed.\nThe Skull # Probably the easiest drawing from this batch. Literally draw a circle for the head, draw a rectangle for the chin, add some details, and you\u0026rsquo;re good to go.\nThe Human Face # This one was the most difficult to create. I tried to draw it exactly as I drew the skull, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the result. For example, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to do with this person\u0026rsquo;s mouth, so I drew a mask just not to think about it for too long.\n","date":"19 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/moments/2025-07-19-learning-pixel-art/","section":"Moments","summary":"","title":"2025-07-19: Learning Pixel Art","type":"moments"},{"content":"","date":"19 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"19 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/digital-art/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Digital Art","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"19 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/moments/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Moments","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"19 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/moments/","section":"Moments","summary":"","title":"Moments","type":"moments"},{"content":"","date":"19 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pixel-art/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pixel Art","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"19 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" By Toby Hudson - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, Link\nEntity Explosion (Q98398855) is a Chrome and Firefox browser extension by Toby Hudson (99of9) which uses API calls to the Wikidata Query Service to match the URL you are browsing on to a Wikidata item, and then display Wikidata data and links.\nTitle: Entity Explosion\nAuthor: Toby Hudson\nURL: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Entity_Explosion\nLicense: GPL-3.0 license\nI would say that results provided by this extension aren\u0026rsquo;t always going to be what you expect, but even these mismatches can be entertaining in their own regard.\nFor example, for now-deleted post from r/todayilearned (by the way, I highly recommend it as a source of daily random interesting facts) about \u0026ldquo;Conan the Bacterium\u0026rdquo; Entity Explosion returns:\nTIL about \u0026quot;Conan the Bacterium\u0026quot;, an organism that's been around for about a billion years more than us, can survive almost anything and will likely outlast us all.\nby u/1Universal_Turtle in todayilearned\nExplosion Entity screenshot showing \u0026lsquo;fact\u0026rsquo;-related links And for the Wikipedia page about \u0026ldquo;Conan the Bacterium\u0026rdquo; (which has a funny name in Latin as well, meaning \u0026ldquo;radiation-surviving terrible berry\u0026rdquo;), the extension predictably returns correct results, since Wikipedia-based projects are deeply interconnected.\nExplosion Entity screenshot showing \u0026lsquo;Deinococcus radiodurans\u0026rsquo;-related links Overall, I think it\u0026rsquo;s a nice extension.

If you dislike any of the artists, feel free to skip their section. For Vocaloid \u0026amp; voice synth in general the producer comes before the voice package they used. For example, it\u0026rsquo;s more important that Utsu-P has created the song than the fact that Hatsune Miku was used as a singer. Sometimes the producer isn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned at all. It\u0026rsquo;s not intended to stay like that \u0026amp; will be fixed eventually. The list isn\u0026rsquo;t nearly complete and most likely will stay like that for a while.

It’s a pity that I didn’t start recording my walkthrough right away. Not that I have any equipment for that, but you never know when the time to become a youtuber might come.\n“Blue Prince” is a game about a young heir who must pass the trial to become the next owner of Mt. Holly mansion. The task is to find the secret 46th room in 45-room mansion “in a timely manner”, but keep in mind: every single day the house map changes.\nThat’s it. The player has an unknown number of days to find 46th room, and every day the house resets, allowing the player to build their path anew using blueprints.\nDrafting (i.e. selecting the next room) in “Blue Prince”, screenshot from Steam (“Blue Prince” → blueprints. Good one.)\nAlmost every time the player opens a new door, there is a choice: one of these three blueprints will become the part of the journey. Choosing one of these rooms is called “drafting”. However, some doors are closed either with a key or a keycard and need to be opened before the player can draft the next room; some rooms cost from one to five gems to draft. Therefore there’s nothing too surprising if the player ends up soft-locking themselves without ever reaching the antechamber.\nMoreover, the number of available actions during the day is also limited by “steps”. Usually the player spends their steps by moving between rooms, though there are several “invisible doors” outside of the mansion as well. If the player runs out of steps, they will be forced to start the next in-game day, as staying in the mansion overnight is prohibited.\nThe mansion itself is filled with riddles. In the beginning of the game “Blue Prince” itself recommends keeping a journal, and my partner and I have written around ten pages by now.\nThe impression # …turned out to be way more difficult to pinpoint than I thought. While playing “Blue Prince” I experience an emotional roller coaster: pure joy from discovering new rooms, items and strategies, confusion and “aha” moments when solving puzzles, even wordless shock when another game session is over and I realize how much progress I made during this run.\n","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sources/blue-prince-dogubomb/","section":"Sources","summary":"","title":"🎮 Blue Prince〈Dogubomb〉","type":"sources"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/creativity-example/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Creativity Example","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/hyperfixation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hyperfixation","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/investigative-reading-material/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Investigative Reading Material","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/maps/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Maps","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/neurodiversity-metaphors/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Neurodiversity Metaphors","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/puns/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Puns","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/resource-management/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Resource Management","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/roguelite/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Roguelite","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/storytelling/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Storytelling","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/strategy-game/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Strategy Game","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/in-progress/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"In Progress","type":"categories"},{"content":" Introduction # “What I Know About: The Series” (WIKA for short) is a set of post sequences which tackle some subject in textbook-like fashion. It’s different from “Research” category, since it doesn’t revolve about any specific research questions and doesn’t aim to create any new knowledge.\nEven during my high school years I have noticed that I don’t like taking notes. I thought the reason was my bad handwriting, but the issue remained the same both when I studied at the university and when I left it. I could spend hours making these notes, and I never re-read them. In some cases I didn’t even read the material before writing it in my notebook or copy-pasting it in Word, Typst, Obsidian…\nMuch later I have realized that I don’t like notes for the same reason why I didn’t like playing with dolls in kindergarten and why speaking to a rubber ducky toy doesn’t work for me as good as it reportedly does for other.\nNeither dolls, rubber ducks nor notes talk to me. While I can imagine some response, I’m restricted by my own life experiences and boundaries of what is even imaginable to me. Talking to others allows me to learn more break these boundaries and get at least a glimpse of what not-my life might look like; what kinds of questions, expectations and answers can non-my experiences provide. And while I know I’m not obliged to publish my notes, having a particular audience in mind significantly affects both my motivation and writing style.\nTherefore, the primary goal of WIKA is to make learning from textbooks more enjoyable via enabling me to share the results of my studies and improve them during discussions with my readers. I’m going to compare different textbooks \u0026amp; other sources and their explanation approaches, while trying to create comprehensive, yet multi-faceted notes.\nAn unexpected side-effect of this approach is that now I’m way more willing to try study techniques that, I thought, required “too much effort”.\nFor example, there’s an active recall technique that requires to take an empty piece of paper, write down everything you remember about the topic and then compare your notes with the original source of that knowledge (textbook, lecture, video, etc.) It turned out that I already have very similar workflow when writing my blog posts: I write down everything I want to say and then I check whether I cited the source correctly (and sometimes even discarding the idea of the post in the process because misunderstanding was too huge and the whole argumentation fell apart because of it!).\nWhat I Know About: The List # [empty for now]\n","date":"22 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/what-i-know-about-the-series/","section":"","summary":"","title":"What I Know About: The Series","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"22 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/concepts/","section":"Concepts","summary":"","title":"Concepts","type":"concepts"},{"content":" Note: this embed acts a bit weird.

I tend not to re-read notes which I wrote for myself. On the one hand, it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat understandable with handwritten notes, since I dislike my handwriting, \u0026ndash; however, the issue persists even when I write Obsidian notes on my laptop. On the other hand, I\u0026rsquo;m way more likely to write something down and then revise \u0026amp; edit it if I write for a blog, giving myself the ability to show my work to the world and gaining the possibility of improving my work even further with readers\u0026rsquo; feedback Eventually I lost any motivation to write in my telegram channel, since there were almost no comments. Even before that I oftentimes felt that I\u0026rsquo;m talking to myself standing on a stage in an empty concert hall \u0026ndash; for two years in row I think we can call the general pattern \u0026ldquo;I prefer to do things with/for the others instead of doing them for/by myself\u0026rdquo;. This has several consequences, e.g. loss of motivation if it turns out that my work was never really needed in the first place. Being autistic, I also tend to overshoot the goal, while my neurotypical peers can\u0026rsquo;t understand why I even worry so much.\nSide note: I can\u0026rsquo;t stop thinking about these quotes from Devon Price\u0026rsquo;s blogpost \u0026ldquo;How Society Forces Autistics to Become Inhibited \u0026amp; Passive\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026ldquo;Was I told sometimes to settle down and get used to how the world is?\u0026rdquo; Eric says. \u0026ldquo;Absolutely, I was. But more often, I would deliver an impassioned speech about my political beliefs or ask if I could wear my sunglasses indoors, and I\u0026rsquo;d just get this blank stare. Like I had not said anything.\u0026rdquo;\nBeing reprimanded for harmless awkwardness really stays with you. I\u0026rsquo;ve never forgotten the fury that Looney Tunes quote had earned me. But I also remember the far more intense and debilitating experience of being completely frozen out. When neuro-conforming people absolutely cannot stand what you have to say, their faces go vacant and they don\u0026rsquo;t even respond. It\u0026rsquo;s even more chilling than being told you\u0026rsquo;re saying something bad.\nEric says, \u0026ldquo;With my gay earrings and my stimming and my outspoken political views I was trying to say see me, see who I am, and everyone would just look past.\u0026rdquo;\nI also have similar experiences, though I wasn\u0026rsquo;t openly contrarian during my childhood.\nIt feels extremely lonely to \u0026ldquo;be seen\u0026rdquo; for completely minuscule things like that I\u0026rsquo;m left-handed, have more than ten tabs open in my browser simultaneously, what I eat, how much time I spend in socials, etc., etc. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard all these unwanted comments so many times from sort many people that I wonder whether there\u0026rsquo;s a hub providing people with all these tasteless comments.\nWhat I wasn\u0026rsquo;t being seen for were my interests. I remember the empty faces of my relatives, classmaam s, so-called friends when I tried to tell them what exactly keeps me going; I remember the silence in return. It got so bad that the best working method of connecting with others was oversharing about my trauma. Then the empathy resources of the others eventually got depleted, and I was all alone again, still completely unseen for who I am as my trauma became my public identity.\nPerhaps the most chilling thing is that in my experience it seems that these empty stares weren\u0026rsquo;t caused by neurotype differences. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard that specific silence both from neurotypical AND autistic people.\nI still don\u0026rsquo;t understand why can\u0026rsquo;t they ask when I\u0026rsquo;m trying to be sarcastic and then actually say something offensive. I still don\u0026rsquo;t understand so many things that it\u0026rsquo;s way easier to continue hiding that to show how vulnerable I am.\nBut I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hide anymore. Don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose the chance of meeting someone who will like me the way I am just because too many people didn\u0026rsquo;t. Don\u0026rsquo;t want to once again forget what makes my eyes sparkle just because no one else cared.\nIn July 2025 I realised that actually I can write for a one particular person if I need someone this much: namely, my partner. I can always show him work, and more-than-often it leads to quite awesome discoveries about our common interests. I finally feel accepted for who I am. If anyone else likes my work \u0026ndash; cool! I just won\u0026rsquo;t count on it by default.\n","date":"22 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/musings/the-need-of-response/","section":"Musings","summary":"","title":"The Need of Response","type":"musings"},{"content":" Title: Vectors, what even are they?\nAuthor: Grant Sanderson\nURL: https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/vectors (YouTube video + transcript)\nDate: 2016-08-06 (published), 2025-03-13 (updated)\nLicense: “Under the standard YouTube license, you are free to embed the videos in your own site or blog, as long as it is not behind a paywall. In both cases, attribution is of course appreciated”. (from FAQ)\nThis post turned out to be more personal that I expected. I didn’t try to retell Grant’s video nor take notes from it: I believe the transcript does both of these jobs good enough. Therefore expect to read a bunch of anecdotes with occasional references to other mathematical fields, terms, etc.\nWhat I found interesting is three different definitions of a vector: I don’t have much experience with linear algebra, but for some reason I’m used to one vector definition at a time. To be more precise, I vaguely remember “vector is a directed line segment” from high school. (In this video it’s called “physics student perspective”, i.e. “arrows pointing in space” (c).)\nThat’s why I was surprised to learn that matrices are vectors and vice versa – for some reason I prefer matrices over vectors.\nAnyways, this brings us to the mathematician’s perspective – physics student perspective plus computer science perspective ‘where \u0026ldquo;vector\u0026rdquo; is pretty much a fancy word for list’. It’s worth noting that the mathematician’s definition is an example of Yoneda lemma:\n[A] vector can be anything where there\u0026rsquo;s a sensible notion of adding two vectors and multiplying a vector by a number, operations that we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about later in this chapter.\nFor reference, Yoneda lemma, simply put, states that to describe an object one needs to describe all its relationships with other objects. (Yep, it’s “referencing category theory concepts while studying way simpler subjects” time.)\nAnother explanation that caught my eye was:\nWhenever you catch a number like \\(2\\), \\(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\)​, or \\(−1.5\\) acting like this, scaling some vector [during multiplication and division by number operations, making the resulting vector shorter, longer, or changing its direction to the opposite one], you call it a \u0026ldquo;scalar\u0026rdquo;. In fact, throughout linear algebra, one of the main things numbers do is scale vectors, so it\u0026rsquo;s common to use the word scalar interchangeably with the word number.\nTo give another definition:\nScalar quantities or simply scalars are physical quantities that can be described by a single pure number (a scalar, typically a real number), accompanied by a unit of measurement, as in \u0026ldquo;10 cm\u0026rdquo; (ten centimeters). \u0026lt;…\u0026gt; Scalars do not represent a direction.\n– Scalar (physics) (Wikipedia)\nI absolutely adore how reading Wikipedia can help to discover unexpected connections between ideas. I thought “oh, how interesting to define a vector as scaling thing in the first sentence and as just a number only in a second one”, and then I saw this:\nThe term \u0026ldquo;scalar\u0026rdquo; has origin in the multiplication of vectors by a unitless scalar, which is a uniform scaling transformation.\n– Scalar (physics) (Wikipedia)\nSo scalar really started as a “thing which scales other things” in the first place and “just a number” in the second.\n","date":"20 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sources/linear-algebra---vectors-what-even-are-they-3blue1brown/","section":"Sources","summary":"","title":"🎥 Linear Algebra: Vectors, what even are they?〈3blue1brown〉","type":"sources"},{"content":"","date":"20 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/linear-algebra/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Linear Algebra","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/scalars/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Scalars","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/vectors/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Vectors","type":"tags"},{"content":" Keep the Rhythm screenshot from Keep the Rhythm\u0026rsquo;s repository by Benjamin Ezequiel Keep the Rhythm is an Obsidian plugin that helps you maintain a consistent writing practice by tracking your daily word count and visualizing it through an elegant heatmap.\nTitle: Keep the Rhythm\nAuthor: Benjamin Ezequiel\nURL: https://github.com/benjaminezequiel/keep-the-rhythm/\nDate: 2024-12-27 (created), 2025-02-22 (latest release)\nLicense: MIT\nThanks to obsi hub for sharing this plugin! 1\nNotes:\nIf you erase words, your word count will go down, which can severely demotivate editing your work if you are more motivated by the amount of words than the actual quality of writing.

Данные факты свидетельствуют о слабой сформированности как ситуативной рефлексии \u0026ndash; способности субъекта соотносить с предметной ситуацией собственные действия, координировать и контролировать элементы деятельности, так и ретроспективной рефлексии способности анализировать уже осуществленную деятельность (навыки самоорганизации и самоконтроля);\n\u0026ndash; неверная квалификация и (или) классификация языкового явления по родовым и видовым признакам и, как следствие, неправильное подведение под понятие при орфографическом анализе слов. Это свидетельствует о том, что некоторые обучающиеся имеют не до конца сформированные базовые логические умения;\n\u0026ndash; неправильное установление аналогий и причинно-следственных связей при пунктуационном анализе предложений. Это свидетельствует о том, что работа с информацией составляет проблему для определенной группы школьников;\n\u0026ndash; невнимательное отношение к информации, передаваемой в микро и макротекстах, «поверхностное» восприятие текстового материала. Это свидетельствует о трудностях при работе с информацией и в результате о низком уровне сформированности у части экзаменуемых коммуникативных универсальных учебных действий (далее \u0026ndash; УУД).\nВ целом я придерживаюсь мнения, что страданий по поводу ЕГЭ (в т.ч. стресса, который за время подготовки сильно изматывает ученика, что увеличивает количество ошибок по невнимательности) было бы гораздо меньше, если бы поступление в топовый вуз на специальность мечты сразу после школы и на бюджет не воспринималось как вопрос жизни и смерти. Добавьте сюда давление со стороны учителей и родителей и страх отстать от сверстников (которые уже поступили, выиграли десять олимпиад и т.д.), и окажется, что у \u0026ldquo;ЕГЭ как проблемы\u0026rdquo; есть немаловажная социальная сторона.\nПоэтому представленные выше \u0026ldquo;свидетельства\u0026rdquo; мне кажутся несколько однобокими 2 и даже обидными. Но интересно, что я в самом деле редко вижу, как на онлайн-курсах учат именно метапредметным навыкам. Встречаются отдельные элементы, но больше как лайфхаки по выполнению конкретных заданий, а не как целый самостоятельный метанавык.\nВероятно, эти метанавыки \u0026ldquo;должна была\u0026rdquo; дать школа, но, боюсь, это немного не так работает. Например, я до сих пор не умею работать с черновиками. Учителя часто жаловались, что в моих тетрадях зачиркано по полстраницы, но я не могу себя заставить думать на черновике. Выписать первые пришедшие мысли? Да. Расписать полный ход решения? Вы что, это же долго, ещё и переписывать на чистовик потом, где начинают идти настоящие усилия\u0026hellip;\nНа ЕГЭ по математике 2023-го года я сдала пять листов развёрнутого ответа. Как минимум один из них был полностью зачёркнут мною же.\nТо есть, недостаточно просто сказать \u0026ldquo;пользуйтесь черновиками\u0026rdquo; или \u0026ldquo;внимательно читайте задание\u0026rdquo;, чтобы выработать навык брейншторма-не-на-чистовике или аналитического чтения. Вероятно, сами эти навыки воспринимаются как нечто самоочевидное, что не нужно раскладывать на компоненты.\nБиблиография # Дощинский, Р.А., Л.Н. Абрамовская, Н.В. Бехтина, О.М. Крайник, и Т.В.

The last time I participated was in ~2018, and I thought it would be a good idea to write a bunch of blog post drafts as a challenge. Given that on March 31st, 2025, there was an announcement that NaNoWriMo shuts down due to lack of sponsors, it might be my very last opportunity to “formally” participate.\nFirst of all, for some reason I didn’t expect the change of NaNoWriMo’s site layout. I actually postponed the start of a challenge for a day, because late in the evening I couldn’t understand why I can’t create an April 2025 Camp NaNoWriMo project. As far as I understand, this is actually by design and I should have signed up for Camp in March to be able to join it. I didn’t let that stop me, and started an “independent” (i.e. not attached to the ongoing challenge) project.\nIt turned out that the timing wasn’t the best either. I have unknowingly strained my back in the late March (more about it at 2025-03-XX Make Sure to Warm Up Beforehand), and during the first week of April I couldn’t walk or even sit much because of the pain. Less walking, among other things, means less experiences and less material to write about, not to mention that I had less energy for writing as my body slowly recovered.\nAnother mistake was to hope to produce high-effort posts during NaNoWriMo. I went by the rules of the main November challenge – produce 50,000 words within a month with little to no editing so the participant’s creativity can flow freely without stumbling upon shame and other obstacles – despite Camp rules allowing to do almost anything you want and how much you want from writing to editing as long as you produce enough words per day.\nAnd while sometimes I produced my own writing, during a few especially bad days I had to literally farm the word count by creating new pages and inserting Obsidian templates and quotes from Wikipedia. To be clear, NaNoWriMo encourages cheating as long as you keep writing, and I was going to create all these pages anyway, but over-relying on this significantly hurt my satisfaction with my own work.\nA few examples of cheating methods (keep in mind that NaNoWriMo’s goal is to write a novel, not a bunch of blog posts):\nChandler\u0026rsquo;s Law:\n\u0026ldquo;If all else fails, have a band of ninjas attack somebody\u0026rdquo; is official advice for writers at a loss for material to further their novel\u0026rsquo;s word count. Or Mr. Ian Woon (which is an anagram of \u0026ldquo;NaNoWriMo\u0026rdquo;). Or The Traveling Shovel of Death. Or a Trebuchet. Or drown someone in ketchup. – NaNoWriMo » Media Notes (TVTropes)\nHowever, it isn’t all that dire. As I write, I constantly generate feedback for myself. Do I need more plugins outside of those mentioned in colophon to make the process smoother? Which topics even come to my mind when I have to write about literally anything?\nTurns out that I tend to write posts about media that impressed me as short-forms and study notes on obscure (at least for a general audience) nerdy topics such as Haskell or accessing RSS feeds via Elfeed in DOOM Emacs. About which, to be honest, I wanted to write for a long time, but I felt that nobody would be interested in reading my Telegram blog if I wrote about these.\n(this is pretty weird, since I know for sure that at least some of my readers work in IT and actually know way more than I do. huh)\n2025-04-30: The End # Today is the last day of the challenge, and I’m spent. A few lessons:\nI was doing rather fine until I switched platforms from Quartz to Hugo and Blowfish, while Hugo and Blowfish weren’t even compatible because of then-recent Hugo updates. For a few days I was literally paralyzed, as I didn’t want to write for Quartz only to have more posts to adapt to Hugo later. I didn’t install any other already working theme for Hugo; I tried to make Blowfish work, and it took way more effort than I expected. Both Hugo’s and Blowfish’ documentation were confusing at times, and some of Hugo’s features don’t work in Blowfish or work differently. For example, Hugo supports both LaTeX and KaTeX, Blowfish supports KaTeX only, and Obsidian plugins are made almost exclusively for LaTeX, creating the need to convert LaTeX to KaTeX before publishing any math-containing page. I was writing or fixing my site without any days off, which eventually caused a minor migraine episode. While no serious harm was done, I suspect that the whole “do something every single day without breaks!” format simply isn’t for me, no matter whether it’s about blogging, studying, etc. I was spending too much time on my laptop, and to have some rest I was… scrolling on my phone. By the end of the day my eyes were dry and my brain was melting, logically inspiring me to restrict my phone usage. This time I didn’t dedicate a separate “day without gadgets”: I stopped using my phone while I’m at home whatsoever, except for few cases when I need to use it (no, the urge to scroll doesn’t count). Fortunately, summer is coming, so I will be able to go outside, sit on a bench in the nearest park and scroll all the time I want – but still, definitely not from home. WRITING TAKES EFFORT. During the last few months of writing for my Telegram blog I got used to low-effort, more slice-of-lifey posts which I could get out of my head in 20-40 minutes. More niche, detailed and better-researched didn’t get the same amount of attention, and that’s why eventually I stopped writing them at all – and it was suffocating many posts about things that make my eyes shine, robbing me of any desire to blog at all. However, returning to at least middle-effort posts wasn’t easy – but I want to be the person who can do difficult things, so here I am and here is my WIKA project. While I didn’t make it to 50,000 words, this NaNo is the first one which I actually finished. Until that my best streak was 18 days, but way more often I dropped the challenge during the first week. And hey, now I actually have my own site with some cool built-in features like localization and embed support!\nAs always, I can’t publish everything I wrote during the challenge. For example, some pages about the way cuprum garden functions were written specifically for Quartz and thus are irrelevant for Hugo + Blowfish.\nBut otherwise? I’m tired, yet happy. The challenge was definitely worth it, but with the same level of certainty I need to take a break from writing (and maybe from the internet whatsoever).\nStay tuned! There’s way more to come :)\nCamp NaNoWriMo (April 2025) results chart ","date":"9 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/2025-04-camp-nanowrimo/","section":"","summary":"","title":"2025-04: Camp NaNoWriMo","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"9 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/challenge/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Challenge","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/creative-process/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Creative Process","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/finished-projects/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Finished Projects","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"9 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/nanowrimo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"NaNoWriMo","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/writing-challenge/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Writing Challenge","type":"tags"},{"content":"We Become What We Behold by Nicky Case! a game about news cycles, vicious cycles, infinite cycles\nTitle: We Become What We Behold\nAuthor: Nicky Case\nURL: https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb\nDate: ?\n“We Become What We Behold” actually was the first game from Nicky Case on which I ever stumbled upon (though \u0026ldquo;The Evolution of Trust\u0026rdquo; seems to be way more popular among my acquaintances).\nI really like how fast it turns into violent chaos, how reporting good news stops working, – and if you don’t close the tab during the credits, you’ll see that in the end the only survivors are the people who tried to stop the massacre.

A parody of amateur adventure design, this metagame consists of a simple treasure hunting game, and a complex editor needed to complete it. The editor and its assistant Cuppit are all part of the game; anyone involved in game or level design should appreciate the humor.\nThe editor is an exercise of twisted logic and lateral thinking. You have to see it to believe it; with its offbeat controls, inventory items that kill you, and intentional misspellings, it\u0026rsquo;s the weirdest thing since sliced bread!\nMETA is based on Adventure Game Studio, the platform for most of our games, and is runner-up for two AGS Awards.\nTitle: META\nAuthor: Crystal Shard\nURL: https://crystalshard.net/?g=4\nDate: 2005\nLicense: ?\nI wonder whether this game has affected the “fix the bugs” genre – titles like Pony Island, to be exact.\n2025-04-06 The First Try # My first experience sure was frustrating. I think META perfectly captures the rage, helplessness and confusion which arise when you want to do something supposedly simple in a new software, but none of its features seem to even remotely do what you want. Add to the mix an incredibly annoying unhelpful helper, and you are on a right way to create the next videogame masterpiece, the legend, the Awesmoe (sic!) Game.\nWell, the TVTropes page has already warned me: “Expect lots of out-of-the-box thinking and meta-solutions.” Ugh.\nI haven’t replayed Pony Island in a while, but I remember it to be more… Straightforward and way less confusing. Another important point is that in Pony Island the player has to fix a game made by someone else (namely the Devil himself) and in META the player is the Awesmoe Game creator. Fixing the old project which you don’t remember making – and of course don’t remember how to use the editor in which the game in question was created – is a frustrating experience as well.\nEven if I don’t return to this game anytime soon, I think it’s a good idea to reflect on aforementioned issues, since I encounter them a lot when I try to find a brand new perfect personal knowledge management setup only to abandon it in a few weeks.\n","date":"6 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sources/meta-crystal-shard/","section":"Sources","summary":"","title":"🎮 META (Crystal Shard)","type":"sources"},{"content":"","date":"6 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/bug-fixing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Bug Fixing","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/game-development/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Game Development","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/intentionally-infuriating/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Intentionally Infuriating","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/parody/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Parody","type":"tags"},{"content":"When I saw Emacs mention on the pages of \u0026ldquo;Haskell Programming from First Principles\u0026rdquo;, I immediately knew what I was going to do in the next few days.

Who might have done this and that? With which probability and how soon a certain even will happen, if ever?\nThis approach somewhat disrupts the reading flow, since from time to time we burst into a lengthy discussion of whatever seemingly minor detail, – but it also made the experience so much richer.\nThe problem is: there are too many small details to keep track of all of them. I believe some kind of (maybe AI-powered) mindmapping software could help with that: what questions were asked, when and which answers were found.\nMoreover, I feel like investigative reading a pretty cool reading club concept, because different people would have different points of view, allowing to engage with the story in a much more multi-faceted way. In particular, my partner suggested started a podcast, and I feel there will be some similarities with Vox Machina\u0026rsquo;s Dungeons and Dragons sessions: (well, at least in terms of “there is a somewhat stable cast with occasional guests”).\nHow I see it: each participant is assigned a role depending on whether they read the work of the day and on how much reading experience they have, – and there’s also someone who takes notes, maybe with help of an AI speech recognition tools. Participants read the work/chapter of choice together, stopping from time to time to discuss both pre-made \u0026amp; occasional questions, using only already read part of the work of the day \u0026amp; the knowledge obtained by reading/watching/playing something else. The results of discussion are written down in a flowchart, allowing to connect questions and hypotheses with answers and actual plot points.\nThe format itself sounds pretty difficult to recreate consistently, therefore:\nIt will be better to start from smaller works; We might need to prioritize quality over quantity and/or consistency of club meetings / podcast episodes.

Spoilers Alert: Following post contains unmarked spoilers to all of the books in A Practical Guide to Evil. You have been warned.\nI highly recommend you to check out this work before reading further, starting at https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/prologue/.\nThe story begins rather slowly, therefore I also recommend to read at least 10 chapters before deciding to drop it.\n2025-03-18 Introduction \u0026amp; Tropes # I believe that eventually this note will become one of the most entertaining to reread. I wish I\u0026rsquo;ve started writing my thoughts down (and publicly) earlier.\nIn short, \u0026ldquo;A Practical Guide to Evil\u0026rdquo; (PGtE for short) is an epic fantasy novel. Of course, this \u0026ldquo;definition\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t describe it fully.\nOne of the most peculiar things about this work is that it\u0026rsquo;s extremely long – 600+ chapters already divided into 7 books in the web version, which might be redivided into 15 books in print – and knowing about PGtE length made me geniunely surprised about how dynamic the plot feels despite diving deeply into the world\u0026rsquo;s lore from time to time. I simply didn\u0026rsquo;t expect, given such a volume, that many plot points would be developed so early on.\nAh, I totally forgot. I\u0026rsquo;ve read 23 out of 600+ chapters by now. I bet my description will change in the future.\nAs for now, the story follows Catherine Foundling, an orphaned 16-ish years old girl, who wants to infiltrate the Empire of Praes\u0026rsquo; army to set her home kingdom of Callow free. However, for some not-very-clear-yet reason she becomes an apprentice of Black Knight – the very guy with eerie green eyes who had a significant role in conquering Callow in the first place.\nBy the way, Good and Evil exist and sometimes grant to those who seem worthy Names – way-more-than-ordinary abilities. Named people should fulfill their Roles, which are extremely similar to character archetypes and their purpose in fiction in general. Incredibly tropey stuff.\n(I wonder how reading \u0026ldquo;Morphology of the Folktale\u0026rdquo; by Vladimir Propp or \u0026ldquo;The Hero with a Thousand Faces\u0026rdquo; by Joseph Campbell would affect my future interpretations of what\u0026rsquo;s going on).\nAnother interesting thing about \u0026ldquo;A Practical Guide to Evil\u0026rdquo; is that it\u0026rsquo;s not very practical, compared to other rational fiction works, though sometimes it provides more obvious lessons similar to those found in \u0026ldquo;Evil Overlord List\u0026rdquo; (basically \u0026ldquo;Things I\u0026rsquo;ll do if I ever become an Evil Overlord\u0026rdquo; aimed to avoid numerous mistakes of fictional villains). Also it\u0026rsquo;s not a guide (i.e. an instruction manual): PGtE – at least so far – doesn\u0026rsquo;t lecture the reader.\n2025-03-22 Catherine # It should be noted that at first I didn\u0026rsquo;t care about PGtE too much. My partner begged me to read it together, and we went through the first 10 chapters or so, but then my migraine showed up once again, with headache overshadowing all my other plans.\nAfter a few months I caught myself thinking: how\u0026rsquo;s Catherine doing, given that we stopped reading right at a cliffhanger, when she is surrounded by other Name claimants and it seems to be “kill or be killed“ kind of situation?\nIt also should be noted that after the pause I was so interested that I simply couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to read with my partner (who, by the way, has already read the whole story). I\u0026rsquo;ve read about 13 chapters in a week despite me being a really slow reader.\nAdditionally, I grew fond of Catherine and started rooting for her. Smart, agentic, strong, sharp tongued orphan girl who fights for a greater essentially Good cause using the resources and knowledge of Evil. Neat! While I don\u0026rsquo;t think \u0026ldquo;Oh, this is so me\u0026rdquo;, I see a few similarities between us, and some of her qualities I\u0026rsquo;d like to foster in myself as well.\n\u0026lsquo;Do it for Catherine\u0026rsquo; meme made by me 2025-03-29 Webtoon # You can also read PGtE in a webtoon adaptation, thought it’s based on an a freshly edited, getting-prepared-to-be-printed version of the book, not the one which is available online for free.\nWhile reading the webtoon, I have noticed that if you try to open chapter 2, you’ll be redirected to some other site which doesn’t even open. I believe that it’s a “subtle” way to convince readers to either log in or create an account. Fortunately, there’s Webtoons MIM Blocker, a Firefox plugin which allows to bypass that.\nTo be honest, I prefer the book over the webtoon. While I truly adore the artstyle, the omission of many, oh so many events, thoughts, lore descriptions makes me sad. Reading the webtoon might be easier, but webtoon-only readers are going to miss soooo much.\n","date":"18 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sources/-a-practical-guide-to-evil-erratic-errata/","section":"Sources","summary":"","title":"📔 A Practical Guide to Evil〈Erratic Errata〉","type":"sources"},{"content":"","date":"18 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/agency/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Agency","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"18 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/books/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Books","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"18 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/deconstruction/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Deconstruction","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"18 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ethics-and-moral-philosophy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ethics and Moral Philosophy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"18 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/fantasy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fantasy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"18 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/rational-fiction/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Rational Fiction","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"18 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/rationality/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Rationality","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"projects"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/creators/","section":"Creators","summary":"","title":"Creators","type":"creators"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/genres/","section":"Genres","summary":"","title":"Genres","type":"genres"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/translators/","section":"Translators","summary":"","title":"Translators","type":"translators"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/year/","section":"Year","summary":"","title":"Year","type":"year"}]
