I was sifting through [[DRAFT Perito|Perito]] archives and stumbled upon the post [[–ù–µ–≤–µ—Ä–æ—è—Ç–Ω—ã–π –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç Expedia –æ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–±—Ä–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–∏ (–°–∞—à–∞ –í–æ—Ä–æ–±—å—ë–≤)]] | (‚ÄúAn Incredible Interactive Expedia Project about the Great Britain‚Äù). 

The post describes 5 videos, in which residents of London, Highlands, Cornwall, Manchester and Wales describe their regions. The project allowed to switch videos without pausing them, making it possible to seamlessly compare accents, clothes, places‚Ä¶

Sadly, nowadays the project is inaccessible: the direct link redirects to Great Britain hotel booking offers and [the archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20170324165312/http://www.expedia.com/greatbritain/experience) simply doesn‚Äôt load past the first 50%. [[DRAFT Flashpoint|Flashpoint]], sadly, didn‚Äôt save this one either (I hope, however, that the mighty archive wizards that maintain Flashpoint can retrieve this one eventually).

However, some materials WERE preserved:
