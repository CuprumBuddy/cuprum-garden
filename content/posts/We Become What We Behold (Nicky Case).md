“We Become What We Behold” actually was the first game from Nicky Case on which I ever stumbled upon (though [[The Evolution of Trust (Nicky Case)]] seems to be way more popular among my acquaintances).

I really like how fast it turns into violent chaos, how reporting good news stops working, – and in the end the only survivors are the people who tried to stop the massacre. Extremely powerful example of short storytelling.
