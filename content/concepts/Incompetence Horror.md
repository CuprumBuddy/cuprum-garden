***SPOILER WARNING*** for “[Don’t Hug Me, I’m Scared](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkPM73HZcYt03hiFlsLGZdIJdF9pYLFU3)” (episodes 1-6) and “[Sex House](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtBnHuIC9ZWl_LhjoqALFYcbD1mbVQlaA)” by The Onion. You might want to watch both of these shows before reading further.

Because of the topic’s nature, this post discusses some rather dark stuff. You were warned.

Recently I have watched a video by Patricia Taxxon about DHMIS unintentionally representing Patricia’s own experience as early-diagnosed and mistreated autistic child.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EZ7cStxqgFE?si=E27VrOdwbUc0Op_W" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Among other things, Patricia describes the the 6th episode reveal of the mastermind behind all these malevolent teachers pestering the protagonists as disappointing: in Patricia’s opinion, the show could have been scarier if the teachers in question weren’t merely controlled by a bunch of buttons, but instead actually represented figures who have power on child’s life – yet are absolutely unreliable. Just like in the “Sex House”, a fake reality show where contestants rely on show-runners, yet the latter don’t understand a thing about how to create a successful reality show and what makes people want sex in the first place. Things go downhill *extremely* quickly, and “reality show” essentially turns into thriller (including *an accidental murder of a person tied in a room full of mold*). 

It really made me think of the Incompetence Horror as a genre. The closest trope to it is probably [Lethally Stupid](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethallyStupid), when character’s not so thought through decisions put anyone else’s life in danger. There’s also [Lethal Negligence](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalNegligence), but it seems like “lethal negligence” is intentional, while “lethal stupidity” isn’t. Compare to [Hanlon’s Razor](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HanlonsRazor): 

> Don't assume malice when stupidity is an adequate explanation. At least, not the first time.
