> In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), and especially in [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory"), a **commutative diagram** is a [diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram_\(category_theory\) "Diagram (category theory)") such that all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result. It is said that commutative diagrams play the role in category theory that [equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations "Equations") play in [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra").
