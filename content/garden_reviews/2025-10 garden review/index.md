## General
- 26/10: had to turn off Nutshell’s “embed this” button, because it created extra line breaks and ruined site design
- 19/10: used Blowfish inbuilt timelines for the first time
- 17/10: started replacing Markdown quotes with Blowfish alerts in Sources metadata cards & descriptions
- 16/10: added support for [Nutshell: make expandable, embeddable explanations](https://ncase.me/nutshell/) by Nicky Case
- 05/10: tried to replace Notion tables with NocaDB ones – for now in cloud, will switch to self-host later if I like the result
