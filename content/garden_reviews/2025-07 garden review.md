## Site changes
- I started working on cuprum garden once again, overcoming the burnout caused by # [2025-04: Camp NaNoWriMo](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/projects/2025-04-camp-nanowrimo/). No more challenges for me, please!
- Authorâ€™s names in pageâ€™s titles are given not in plain parentheses, but in Japanese angle brackets. Kudos to [Japanese with Anime](https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2017/05/quotation-marks-japanese.html) for the article that helped me decide which ones to choose.
