##  General
- 17/09/25: 
	- started IndieWebifying my site
		- added link to this site to my GitHub profile
		- added an authorization endpoint
- 14/09/25:
	- it turns out that links put in the image description are perfectly clickable (sadly, hyperlinks aren’t available), which means I can make my site a bit prettier by having a different text style for image captions instead of using Markdown quotes for everything
- 13/09/25:
	- added custom homepage sections grouped by category – had to vibecode those since Blowfish doesn’t have such a feature and I had no idea how to implement these myself. The resulting design, sadly, isn’t as beautiful, but at least IT WORKS, which is a great achievement by itself
- 11/09/2025:
	- considered adding series of articles, couldn’t really come up with a series (maybe later…)
	- added subnavigation to menu bar
- 10/09/2025: 
	- started adding thumbnails to already published posts
	- reshuffled categories, concentrating “Musings”, “Projects” & “Moments” in “Personal” tab
	- added “Tags” tab
	- stopped showing articles from “Sources” & “Knowledge Base” in “Recent” section on the homepage
- 09/09/2025: added site description on homepage (also known as “headline” in language config)
