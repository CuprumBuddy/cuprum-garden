## Introduction

Recently (I mean, literally yesterday) I've decided to learn pixel art. It wasn't my first decision of this kind, but the last time I drew something was back in 2022, so it probably doesn't change much anyway.

This time I used one of Pedro Medeiros' [Pixel Art Articles](https://saint11.art/pixel_articles/), namely [1 - An Absolute Beginner's Guide](https://saint11.art/pixel_art_articles/article1). The first exercise (aside from getting Aseprite running) was to draw a mug, a sword, a skull & a human face *before* the basics were explained.

## The Mug

Pedro Medeiros suggested to use [ARQ4](https://lospec.com/palette-list/arq4) palette, but Libresprite didn't have an built-in one, so I used monokai instead. It turned out kinda weird in terms of both shape and colour choices -- I wonder what it will look like if I redraw it after a few more months of practice.

## The Sword

At this moment I stopped trying to use a specific palette (though I chose a different preset for each of these three images). This one is an attempt to draw an RPG Maker-esque icon without a reference. I think it could have worked as it is for certain artstyles, but I wish I knew how to make it more detailed.

## The Skull

Probably the easiest drawing from this batch. Literally draw a circle for the head, draw a rectangle for the chin, add some details, and you're good to go.

## The Human Face

This one was the most difficult to create. I tried to draw it exactly as I drew the skull, but I didn't like the result. For example, I didn't know what to do with this person's mouth, so I drew a mask just not to think about it for too long.
