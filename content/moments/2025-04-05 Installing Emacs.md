When I saw Emacs mention on the pages of "Haskell Programming from First Principles", I immediately knew what I was going to do in the next few days. I have never used Emacs before – only heard about in the context of personal knowledge management – therefore Emacs had that mysterious allure similar to the one that made me look into Haskell itself. I expected to encounter something incredibly complex, but also inevitably mind-changing.

I write it at 16:40, because my partner just has finished 7 hour long Emacs installation session. I think it’s not the Emacs fault *per se*; it would be much faster if we researched what Emacs version we need and if I had enough space on my laptop for the Haskell setup beforehand. And I believe installing additional packages for Haskell support turned out more difficult than installing Emacs itself…

So, now I have Emacs in its all not-yet-comprehensible glory. Wish me luck.
