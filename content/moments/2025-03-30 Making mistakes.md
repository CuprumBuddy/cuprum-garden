When my partner and I read [ðŸ“” A Practical Guide to Evil (Erratic Errata)](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/sources/-a-practical-guide-to-evil-erratic-errata/), I usually read as Catherine, and in the beginning my performance was quite bad. I stumbled on longer sentences, stressed words incorrectly, and my intonations were anything but fitting the situation.

It became better over time, and at some point I started reading whole sentences without stumbling â€“ though intonation was still out of place. My partner said:

â€“ Do you understand whatâ€™s going on in this scene? I donâ€™t think Catherine would say it like that, but okay, Iâ€™m not criticizing youâ€¦

â€“ I know it was weird, â€“ I answered. â€“ I didnâ€™t mean to read it like that, I just canâ€™t do better for now.

Basically, I *still* was making mistakes, *but* I read good enough for my partner to think that I was doing it on purpose (and I wasnâ€™t). Quite a lesson about judging peopleâ€™s intentions only by the results of their actions.
