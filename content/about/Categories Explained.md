My partner once told me that the categories on my site are confusing and he doesn’t know what they are supposed to mean. Of course, he told me this a few site iterations ago, but I was going to write down this explanation anyway, so here it is.

Note that not all of these categories are clickable (yet). Some require too much brain power for me to fill, and some parent categories are disabled by design, though the latter is more of an exception than a rule.

## Personal

My “less serious” writing which usually isn’t supported by proper research and/or focuses on my personal experiences.
- [Musings](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/musings/) – literally my thoughts which aren’t tied to more specific entities from “Sources” and “Knowledge Base”.
- [Moments](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/moments/) – events from my life (hopefully ones that led me to some insights, but not necessarily).

## Projects

Exactly what it says on the tin.

Note that this parent category can’t be clicked, i.e. you can’t look at all of my projects in one tab. It’s like that on purpose: I have plenty of ideas, and I don’t want to create a false impression of “doing too much at once” because my potential projects got mixed up with stuff that I actively work on. The user has to make at least somewhat conscious choice: “Yes, I want to learn more about Ideas, and I don’t expect that these were already brought to life by Cuprum Buddy”.

- Three main categories ([Finished](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/categories/finished-projects/), [In Progress](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/categories/in-progress/), [Ideas](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/categories/in-progress/)) are pretty straightforward and refer to a state of a project.
- “[Never-ending](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/categories/never-ending/)” projects are similar to Wikipedia’s [dynamic lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Dynamic_lists) – I don’t expect them to ever be fully completed. 
## Sources

~ “something you could cite in your paper”. Usually includes:
- metadata (name, author, URL, date, maybe license)
- official description
- my commentary
- extra links to learn more about this specific source / related topics

This category is difficult to define, since I don’t have any policy explaining what “deserves” it’s own post and what doesn’t. However, it’s more of “behind the scenes” issue: sometimes I start a post as a Source one and realize that it’s more about a specific Concept I have in mind, not just one single book/video/series/etc.

Not sure whether there will be a separate category for music, because [🎸 cuprum jukebox](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/projects/cuprum-jukebox/) already has hundreds of songs and individual pages for these could easily clutter the site with, well, my personal stories about most of them, and I don’t really consider these “clutter”… Maybe I’ll reconsider.
## Knowledge Base

- Comparisons
- Concepts – term explanations & explorations. 
- Creatures – alive, not quite alive, imaginary, you name it. Examples: octopi, Conan the Bacterium, bacteriophages, unicorns.
- Experiments – initially intended for analysis of commonly cited scientific experiments, since it’s hilarious to see how many different points can be “proven” with one influential study.
- Notions – similar to Concepts, but closer to ideas than individual terms. E.g. “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” and how it can be interpreted.
- Places
- Techniques – ways to achieve some goals which are not step-by-step Tutorials.
- Tools – mostly software, but may include something physical as well.
- Tutorials
- WIKA – has its own [page](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/projects/what-i-know-about-the-series/).

## About

All about this very site (and maybe about me if I ever feel the desire to have a proper “About” page).
## Garden Review

Monthly review of what was written, updated, (re)uploaded, broken, fixed, you get it.

Given that I decided to use “note created” date as the main instead of “when the post was published” one, it can be very confusing to follow updates. There’s always something happening in the background even if it seems like there’s nothing new, and I want to show that writing actually takes a lot of time from idea to (somewhat) completed post. I believe it’ll be especially confusing for RSS users who are used to get the latest updates and ignore anything that’s older than two weeks (or whatever one’s settings say).

In any case, if you ever feel lost, consider checking the garden review, published in the last days of every month whenever anything has happened on this site.
## Tags

Automatically updated list of tags. 

Eventually there also will be:
- a description for every single tag (requires creating a ton of [tag-associated pages](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/associate-a-description-with-a-tag/50112) in individual folders which is obviously time-consuming).
- a table comparing tags across all language versions of the site – hopefully someday I’ll be able to translate my writing into multiple languages, so this is intended to ensure tag consistency and reduce redundancy.
