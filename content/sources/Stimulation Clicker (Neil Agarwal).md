A short (~1 hour long) clicker game about stimulation with which internet bombards us every single day. 

Love the fact that after all, the player themselves decides what will be present on the screen, i.e. what will earn them stimulation (and eventually overwhelms them). 10/10 raising screen time awareness tool. 

(Also I’m happy that I played it without sound. I *don’t* want to know what it sounds like).

More details that *caught my attention*:

- The game also provides “soothing” experiences like listening to the sound of rain, Lo-Fi girl, which actually just add up with all the other distractions.
	- Also “meditation” and “meditate twice as fast” combined with “screen time tracker” for “developing healthy habits”. And “fitness instructor” for “staying fit with your screen”.
- The further you play, the more interactive the game becomes with Duolingo owl asking random questions, timed lootboxes, stock market minigame…

I got 29/35 achievements, and in the end my screen looked like this – I mean, absolutely terrible.
