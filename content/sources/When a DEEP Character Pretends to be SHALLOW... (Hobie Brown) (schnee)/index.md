A character who you ‚Äì the protagonist & the viewer ‚Äì start hating because he is so cool‚Ä¶ But after a while you realize that yeah, he‚Äôs awesome and you actually can‚Äôt hate him despite the fact that he‚Äôs better than you in almost every sense (which makes you feel inferior)‚Ä¶

The thing is ‚Äì I *DIDN‚ÄôT* feel all of these while watching the movie (maybe because I‚Äôve seen too many spoilers beforehand). Yeah, Hobie had that parody vibe, but I always thought that his parody is intentional. He‚Äôs *the* punk, after all. Why would one expect him to adhere to whatever forced standards of seriousness?

Yet this video makes something in my brain move. I didn‚Äôt have these feelings; nonetheless, I recognize them. I recognize the insecurity.

On personal level, can‚Äôt help but note the darker side of belonging as well ‚Äì ‚Äúno one who acts out of the line and no one who doesn‚Äôt belong‚Äù is allowed in the Spider-society, where every single person has to survive a trauma of losing a significant other. And how dare you say these sacrifices aren‚Äôt necessary? Either you comply or you get thrown away. Must be easy to be accepting when you accept only those who agree with you, y‚Äôknow.

The main takeaway of this video from the media criticism standpoint is that depth isn‚Äôt about how many facts the audience knows about a character, it‚Äôs about presentation. And yeah, creators can put a lot of heart into intricate worlds and it‚Äôs incredibly tempting to show viewers EVERYTHING‚Ä¶ But extremely detailed worldbuilding doesn‚Äôt necessarily compensate for boring dynamics between characters, and/or non-existent plot, and/or any other things that can break the viewer‚Äôs [:suspension of disbelief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief). But more can be achieved with less, and five minutes of total screen time can give the audience a lot to think about.
