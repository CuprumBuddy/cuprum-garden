> A new paper shows that a generative AI model can design viable bacteriophages.

Can’t provide much commentary this time, but I’d like to highlight this excerpt:

> So even though this new preprint isn’t the first time that researchers have designed and built a synthetic genome, it _is_ the first time an AI model has allowed them to go “off script” and create viable genomes that humans, rationally, could not. Some of the viable phage genomes created in this work are so distinct from any known bacteriophage genome that they would technically be classified as their own species.

I think it says something AI creativity – while the originality of art is always somewhat debatable, no matter whether it was created by a human or an AI, the creation of *an entire new species* seems like a more objective criterion.
