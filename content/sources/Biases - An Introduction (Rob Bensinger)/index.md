This is the first mindmap that I created for "R:AZ - A Roadmap". It's kinda barebones and doesn't cover everything that I consider important in this post, but I think it's a good start.

The mindmap was created in [Excalidraw for Obsidian](), and the picture itself is SVG (i.e. it can be zoomed in without losing quality).
