An **EXTREMELY** thorough textbook. It wonâ€™t be suitable for learning Italian as a beginner, since the amount of information is rather overwhelming, but otherwise itâ€™s an excellent resource for more proficient students whoâ€™d like to get a better understanding of grammar & Italian teachers. 

For a while the 4th edition of *Soluzioni* was my go-to textbook for What I Know About Italian project. However, the book is so concise yet comprehensive that I started to fear that I would run into copyright issues sooner of later if I ever publish these posts so I largely had to switch to textbooks with permissive licenses.
