‚Äúslash pages‚Äù is mostly a list which consists of:
- the proposed page name
- a short 1-2 sentence description of a page
- a link to an external source explaining the purpose of the page, how to create and update it, etc.
- a link to a directory with examples of the page in question

All things considered, it might be a great source of inspiration, especially if you don‚Äôt mind exploring extra explanations and examples.
