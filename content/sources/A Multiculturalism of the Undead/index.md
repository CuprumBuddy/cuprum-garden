> Labeling the undead figures in non-European mythology, popular culture, and academia as “vampires” doesn’t make sense.

> For not all of the world’s legions of undead are nocturnal blood-predators with fangs. Andrew Hock Soon Ng argues that vampire-universalism, particularly prevalent now on the internet, is very much misplaced. “Non-Western undead embodiments, particularly from Asia, cannot be classified as vampires,” he writes. In fact, “subsuming non-Western undead creatures under the vampire as a category expresses more than just an Orientalist assertion; it is also a denial of the vampire’s singularity and the unique circumstances determining it.”

> In a topology of such supernatural figures, the Euro-vampire should be put into a “comparative cross-cultural analysis between undead entities from different parts of the world.” From Asia, other such beings include the Indian _baital_, the Chines _jiangshi_, the Japanese _bakeneko_, the Indonesian [_pontianak_](https://daily.jstor.org/the-indonesian-frontier-town-named-for-a-jungle-vampire/), and the Philippine _aswang._

This post inspired several research questions:
- How exactly Enlightenment science & rationality affected the development of vampire representation in literature?
- In which proportion count Dracula was inspired by Vlad III of Wallachia vs historical context of Victorian Britain?
- How Asian undead were made more European & vampire-like by translators of works in which these “vampires” have appeared? Did these changes affect the perception of undead in their countries of origin?
- Which European undead were “vampirified”?

> In short, let all the undead rise…and be themselves.
