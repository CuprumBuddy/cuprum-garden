> In (hopefully) the shortest and best way I could, I‚Äôve put together an incredibly brief guide on what‚Äôs going on with these ‚Äúspiritual successors‚Äù that everyone keeps talking about. The companies I‚Äôve listed below are confirmed to have ex-ZA/UM employees that have worked on Disco Elysium in some capacity.
>
> Please note, these lists may change at any time. I‚Äôll do my best to keep it up-to-date.¬†_**Roles in parentheses are from Disco Elysium's credits, and does not necessarily mean that is what they're working for in their current position.**_
>
> Also, please note: The links to the devs are only for reference and should not be used to harass or bombard these devs for any reason whatsoever. I simply provide them as a means to follow and keep up to date on what the devs are doing. We don't typically allow links from X per our rules- unfortunately, some of these devs are most active on there. So sorry.
