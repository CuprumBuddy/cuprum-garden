**WARNING:** This game provides rather unique experience. While I write this post mainly to share my emotions (and not important plot twists and / or strategies), remember: the less you know before the start of the game, the more you will be able to figure out by yourself.

The game might seem pricey – don’t trust the embed above though if you use a VPN, as the price depends on your region – but if puzzles are your cup of tea, then “Blue Prince” has a good chance to turn out to be worth every penny.

## Game description

Pure [Investigative Reading Podcast](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/projects/investigative-reading-podcast/) material. It’s a pity that I didn’t start recording my walkthrough right away. Not that I have any equipment for that, but you never know when the time to become a youtuber might come.

“Blue Prince” is a game about a young heir who must pass the trial to become the next owner of Mt. Holly mansion. The task is to find the secret 46th room in 45-room mansion “in a timely manner”, but keep in mind: every single day the house map changes.

That’s it. The player has an unknown number of days to find 46th room, and every day the house resets, allowing the player to build their path anew using blueprints.

(“Blue Prince” → blueprints. Good one.)

Almost every time the player opens a new door, there is a choice: one of these three blueprints will become the part of the journey. Choosing one of these rooms is called “drafting”. However, some doors are closed either with a key or a keycard and need to be opened before the player can draft the next room; some rooms cost from one to five gems to draft. Therefore there’s nothing too surprising if the player ends up soft-locking themselves without ever reaching the antechamber.

Moreover, the number of available actions during the day is also limited by “steps”. Usually the player spends their steps by moving between rooms, though there are several “invisible doors” outside of the mansion as well. If the player runs out of steps, they will be forced to start the next in-game day, as staying in the mansion overnight is prohibited.

The mansion itself is filled with riddles. In the beginning of the game “Blue Prince” itself recommends keeping a journal, and my partner and I have written around ten pages by now.

## The impression
…turned out to be way more difficult to pinpoint than I thought. While playing “Blue Prince” I experience an emotional roller coaster: pure joy from discovering new rooms, items and strategies, confusion and “aha” moments when solving puzzles, even wordless shock when another game session is over and I realize how much progress I made during this run.
