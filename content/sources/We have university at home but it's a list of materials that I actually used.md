I was going to release my self-study curriculum (dubbed “AI & Neuroscience degree“), but for now – and probably for the foreseeable future – it’s a beautiful mess full of links which I haven’t opened and therefore can’t wholeheartedly [not] recommend. 

The list below is divided into subtopics. Subtopics are in alphabetical order, not in the order me, you, or anyone else should study those. The sources go in ~order: 
- lists of links
- all-in-one textbooks/courses
- broader explanations [e.g. “matrices in linear algebra“]
- narrower explanations [e.g. “matrices multiplication“]

Someday I will be able to comment on why I used those and what my impressions were. In this case I expect myself to write both/either:
- a small review in this list
- a separate page – in this case the source title will become purple, indicating the link

For the month-based review of what I was studying see the original [“We have university at home”](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/projects/we-have-university-at-home/).
