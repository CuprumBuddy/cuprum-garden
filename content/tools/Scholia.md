> Scholia is a service that creates visual scholarly profiles for topics, people, organizations, species, chemicals, etc using bibliographic and other information in Wikidata.

In other words, Scholia can be described as a set of research-focused premade Wikidata queries which use data from Wikidata and English Wikipedia. Queries may include: 
- recent publications by author/organization / on topic (with an RSS feed!)
- earliest published works on topic
- which research instruments were used
- co-occurring research topics
- co-author graph
- most cited papers
- gender distribution (for organizations)
- citing authors
- citations by year
- associated images
- events the author attended

Note that data provided by Wikidata might be incomplete, biased, incorrect, etc etc. Therefore:
- consider contributing to both Wikidata & Wikipedia
- personally, I would use Scholia mostly for inspiration and sources / keywords search, not as a source of reliable statistics and/or graphs
