I have tons of materials in my backlog. Obviously, I won‚Äôt be able to write about or even read every single item with a headline that caught my eye, which means that most of my ‚Äúread later‚Äù list won‚Äôt be of any use neither for me nor my readers. Also I‚Äôve noticed that I revisit my own site way more often than my saved messages, images in the gallery, reading apps, YouTube playlists and all the other silos. Given that my personal goal is to significantly reduce the amount of places where a particular link, image or whatever could eventually <s>get lost</s> end up, I don‚Äôt see the reasons not to share 

Links in tables below are sorted alphabetically. Hopefully the list will eventually become a bit smaller. See the [Sources](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/categories/source/) category if you‚Äôre interested in what I‚Äôve already read and hopefully even wrote something about.

Note that I **DON‚ÄôT** recommend anything listed. I‚Äôm not familiar with any of these sources, and while it would be nice to accidentally give someone a good recommendation, chances are that I unknowingly spread something low quality or dangerous. If you decide to discuss that ‚Äì either with me personally or on your own social media ‚Äì please be respectful. Reasons why something should be removed from the list (and what to replace it with) will be appreciated.
