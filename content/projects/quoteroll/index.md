Friendship is not the warm bath of recognition; it is the safe-cracking of reality. Two idiots put their ears to the vault door of the world and whisper, ‚ÄòOn three.‚Äô Click.

‚ÄúA word is not the same with one writer as it is with another. One tears it from his guts. The other pulls it out of his overcoat pocket.‚Äù This is how Charles Peguy described writing individual words. The same thing is true of chapters and whole books. [...] It seems appropriate to acknowledge everyone who contributed to the long process, either by loaning me an overcoat or by helping me clean up my spilled guts.

‚ÄúHe managed to betray a villain called ‚Äòthe Betrayer‚Äô, Squire,‚Äù Ratface grinned. ‚ÄúYou have to hand it to him: he might have had only one trick but he was <i>great</i> at it.‚Äù
<br>
<br>
I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be a little more impressed if he‚Äôd ruled longer than a decade. That kind of stupidity is why you don‚Äôt put the comic relief in charge.‚Äù
<br>
<br>
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to respect that kind of an exit, though,‚Äù Robber mused. ‚ÄúI mean, poisoning himself and pinning it on over a hundred different people? Man knew how to leave the stage.‚Äù

I imagine if I tried to date him, it'd be a lot of work to get him to understand me, like I'd have to force feed him myself. I'd rather have someone who's hungry.

[A]s Oliver Burkeman advises in <a href="https://curtismchale.ca/book/meditations-for-mortals-oliver-burkeman/">Meditations for Mortals</a> there is freedom in realizing that you won‚Äôt get everything done, that most of your tasks don‚Äôt matter and you should let them go because you‚Äôre never going to do them. They‚Äôre not valuable enough to bother with.
<br><br>
The problem isn‚Äôt that you haven‚Äôt found the right tool to control your tasks, it‚Äôs that you think it‚Äôs possible to control every task that flows your way.
<br><br>
The reason a new tool, or a new system for that matter, feels so good is that you give up on so many of the tasks that were weighing you down in the old system. You don‚Äôt move every idea over figuring that you‚Äôll come back to them at some point, and then you never come back.

The same thing happens when RFK Jr says ‚Äúwhen I was a kid, no one had autism‚Äù. Which is technically true. But only because the diagnosis of autism wasn‚Äôt officially recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) until 1980. Which is <i>after</i> RFK Jr was a kid.
<br><br>
So yes, there <i>was</i> no autism when he was a kid. But it‚Äôs not because there was anything special and healthy about being a kid in the 50s and 60s.

I've worked in spam and abuse at Google, and I have friends who have worked in trust and safety at Meta and Twitter. Anyone who has worked in any spam and abuse role knows that these platforms are under fire and adversarial attack basically all the time. Which makes me think Krugman‚Äôs take is way too simplistic. ‚ÄúEnshittification is <i>their</i> fault. They are doing it on purpose because <moral failing>.‚Äù Krugman is definitely pointing to a real phenomenon, and his writing is insightful as usual. But like many of those critical of the modern tech landscape, Krugman only points the cannons of his criticism outward.
<br><br>
Point me to some form of enshittification, and I'll find someone abusing the system that is making it worse for everyone. Honestly, most of the time I can't even blame them. Sure, I'm not personally like trashing my Airbnbs and then suing the host, or whatever. But I share my Netflix password, or use other people's promo codes, or use student discounts when I'm no longer a student. We all have incentives.

The trauma narrative feels like a rejection of the pain, because it's a belief that the pain is somehow not supposed to be there, like it's a foreign invader. I feel uncomfortable treating it like an invader (although I still do it sometimes because of social pressure).
<br> <br>
There can be a lot of healing in surrendering the narrative and all the power and authority it gives you. I don't mean that you have to abandon it entirely, it's useful, after all - but evicting it from a place of identity inside yourself is necessary. If your wound is held open by a sense of wrongness, it will never have space to heal.

I feel like I‚Äôm in absolute <i>crazytown</i> that everyone seems to think the school system is okay. You‚Äôre pouring the most vivid years of someone‚Äôs life into the fucking drain, forcing them to sit and wait and stare at walls and spend their attention focusing on stuff that most of them don‚Äôt care about at all, and will barely remember afterwards. This is how you treat property, not people.
