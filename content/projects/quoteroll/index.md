When you stop translating, extraordinary things happen. Your creative, social, and intellectual bandwidth expands dramatically. The cognitive load of constant performance was enormous‚Äîevery conversation where you were editing rather than expressing depleted resources that could be directed toward creation, insight, genuine connection.
<br><br>
You discover your actual audience: not the people who need you to be different, but the ones who recognize themselves in your untranslated truth. This isn't about finding "your tribe"‚Äîthat suggests a pre-existing community waiting to be discovered. It's about creating resonance through specificity.

The slut is, after all, a fundamentally pro-social archetype. While the term has grown to be broad and welcoming (as Aella made sure to say explicitly, ‚Äúanyone can be a slut‚Äù), the slut more traditionally represents someone who has had- or at least is perceived to have had- many sexual partners. She is assumed to be sexually open, available, ‚Äúloose,‚Äù which even as an insult implies an undeniably complimentary relaxed quality. The slut enjoys sex, in the normal way that sex is enjoyable.
<br><br>
The pervert, in contrast, is antisocial. His desires are at odds with normative sex and sexuality, often divorced or abstracted from the mechanics of sex and/or hyperfocused in a way that alienates potential partners, if partnership is something the Pervert is interested in at all. Perversion is a curdling; a rancid inversion of something wholesome. The Pervert is sexually obsessed, yes, but impotent either through shame or rebuff.
<br><br>
The slut gives panties away, or shows off the lace in hopes of them peeled off her body. The pervert sneaks into her room at night and steals them.
<br><br>
The slut gives, the pervert takes.
<br><br>
Prosocial/antisocial.

Following a long period of chronic personal and professional stress, I had retreated to a (metaphoric) cave for a couple of years and simply stopped going to professional conferences and other social/professional venues where I typically met emerging scholars in the field and reconnected with longtime colleagues and friends. And in truth, I didn‚Äôt write much (at least, not much that I cared about). Then I got a cold email from Robin. I almost never respond to cold emails (and I‚Äôve never taken a cold phone call in my life), but this one was different from the usual sort [...], so I responded. Suffice it to say, Robin got my attention, and kept it, and we began meeting, and talking, and reading together, and not long after, writing together. Thank you, Robin, for waking up my brain again, for being my muse, for knowing exactly how to finish my sentences and for letting me finish yours. Working with you has been like working with my own younger self, if my younger self had known back then what I know now 20 years later, but still had some energy and vitality left in me.

‚ÄúA word is not the same with one writer as it is with another. One tears it from his guts. The other pulls it out of his overcoat pocket.‚Äù This is how Charles Peguy described writing individual words. The same thing is true of chapters and whole books. [...] It seems appropriate to acknowledge everyone who contributed to the long process, either by loaning me an overcoat or by helping me clean up my spilled guts.

‚ÄúHe managed to betray a villain called ‚Äòthe Betrayer‚Äô, Squire,‚Äù Ratface grinned. ‚ÄúYou have to hand it to him: he might have had only one trick but he was <i>great</i> at it.‚Äù
<br>
<br>
I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be a little more impressed if he‚Äôd ruled longer than a decade. That kind of stupidity is why you don‚Äôt put the comic relief in charge.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to respect that kind of an exit, though,‚Äù Robber mused. ‚ÄúI mean, poisoning himself and pinning it on over a hundred different people? Man knew how to leave the stage.‚Äù

I imagine if I tried to date him, it'd be a lot of work to get him to understand me, like I'd have to force feed him myself. I'd rather have someone who's hungry.

[A]s Oliver Burkeman advises in <a href="https://curtismchale.ca/book/meditations-for-mortals-oliver-burkeman/">Meditations for Mortals</a> there is freedom in realizing that you won‚Äôt get everything done, that most of your tasks don‚Äôt matter and you should let them go because you‚Äôre never going to do them. They‚Äôre not valuable enough to bother with.
<br><br>
The problem isn‚Äôt that you haven‚Äôt found the right tool to control your tasks, it‚Äôs that you think it‚Äôs possible to control every task that flows your way.
<br><br>
The reason a new tool, or a new system for that matter, feels so good is that you give up on so many of the tasks that were weighing you down in the old system. You don‚Äôt move every idea over figuring that you‚Äôll come back to them at some point, and then you never come back.

The same thing happens when RFK Jr says ‚Äúwhen I was a kid, no one had autism‚Äù. Which is technically true. But only because the diagnosis of autism wasn‚Äôt officially recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) until 1980. Which is <i>after</i> RFK Jr was a kid.
<br><br>
So yes, there <i>was</i> no autism when he was a kid. But it‚Äôs not because there was anything special and healthy about being a kid in the 50s and 60s.

I've worked in spam and abuse at Google, and I have friends who have worked in trust and safety at Meta and Twitter. Anyone who has worked in any spam and abuse role knows that these platforms are under fire and adversarial attack basically all the time. Which makes me think Krugman‚Äôs take is way too simplistic. ‚ÄúEnshittification is <i>their</i> fault. They are doing it on purpose because <moral failing>.‚Äù Krugman is definitely pointing to a real phenomenon, and his writing is insightful as usual. But like many of those critical of the modern tech landscape, Krugman only points the cannons of his criticism outward.
<br><br>
Point me to some form of enshittification, and I'll find someone abusing the system that is making it worse for everyone. Honestly, most of the time I can't even blame them. Sure, I'm not personally like trashing my Airbnbs and then suing the host, or whatever. But I share my Netflix password, or use other people's promo codes, or use student discounts when I'm no longer a student. We all have incentives.

The trauma narrative feels like a rejection of the pain, because it's a belief that the pain is somehow not supposed to be there, like it's a foreign invader. I feel uncomfortable treating it like an invader (although I still do it sometimes because of social pressure).
<br> <br>
There can be a lot of healing in surrendering the narrative and all the power and authority it gives you. I don't mean that you have to abandon it entirely, it's useful, after all - but evicting it from a place of identity inside yourself is necessary. If your wound is held open by a sense of wrongness, it will never have space to heal.

I feel like I‚Äôm in absolute <i>crazytown</i> that everyone seems to think the school system is okay. You‚Äôre pouring the most vivid years of someone‚Äôs life into the fucking drain, forcing them to sit and wait and stare at walls and spend their attention focusing on stuff that most of them don‚Äôt care about at all, and will barely remember afterwards. This is how you treat property, not people.
