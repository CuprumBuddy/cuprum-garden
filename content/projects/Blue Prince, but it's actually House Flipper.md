You did it! You have successfully [inherited your grunkle Herbert P. Sinclair’s enormous mansion with its endless mysteries](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/sources/blue-prince-dogubomb/). However, the place is a wreck, and it’s up to you to restore it. Meanwhile, there’s also more to explore in Reddington, and eventually you’ll be able to decide to whom should the mansion open its doors (if at all).

(It’s also an opportunity to learn more about early 1990s homemaking practices, if you ever need this information)
