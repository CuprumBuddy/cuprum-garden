Honestly, I’m not very good at asking questions. Even basic things such as “How are you?” usually don't come into my mind, especially if I don't really know anything about a person; same goes for new topics. *Do you have any questions?* the professor asks, while I still haven't processed the lecture. 

So, if asking questions is a skill – let’s practice it! Given that I read a lot of seemingly irrelevant stuff, there’s always something to explore. While I don't expect myself to actively *look for* answers to these questions, you never know what patterns & hidden connections you may find someday in the future.

The table below was created in NocoDB and, sadly, its embeds don’t work properly. [^1] Treat the embed below as a preview and follow [this link](https://app.nocodb.com/#/nc/view/5e6e4a6a-ef77-4788-b260-bcb03e55c776) to see everything & get better UX.

[^1]: But at least it allows to sort & filter. If NocaDB is also less laggy than Notion when dealing with 100+ rows, then might become my main dynamic tables provider. We’ll see.
