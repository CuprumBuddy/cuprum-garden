I always don't really know what to say when people ask about my favourite music. Here's a Notion database, so I can run queries to analyse what's going on and readers can listen to whatever songs the might like.

It would have been easier to provide a single playlist with all these song, but I don't actually use any major music streaming platforms (except for YouTube Music occasionally, which I despise); moreover, my favourite songs tend to have drastically different vibes, especially when it comes to Vocaloid & other voice synth artists.

Other notes:
- The song list is sorted by the artist. If you dislike any of the artists, feel free to skip their section.
    - For Vocaloid & voice synth in general the producer comes before the voice package they used. For example, it's more important that Utsu-P has created the song than the fact that Hatsune Miku was used as a singer.
- Sometimes the producer isn't mentioned at all. It's not intended to stay like that & will be fixed eventually.
- The list isn't nearly complete and most likely will stay like that for a while. I have over \~3,000 songs saved over the years in two social networks, and migrating these list here is going to take a while.
- I wish readers could sort & filter the database however they like, but Notion doesn't allow that when you share something in view-only regime. You can't sort & filter the columns directly, but you can use built-in search (click the magnifying glass in the right corner).
- For some songs I will add more info on their individual pages, but at the moment most of such pages are empty. Please don't sift through them (for now).

Press three dots in the right corner, then "View original page" for better (at least fullscreen) experience.
