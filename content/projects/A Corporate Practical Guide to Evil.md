I realize that, I believe, this work will never be written as a fanfic, or brought to life via any other form of media except for blogposts – at least not by my hand – because it requires immense knowledge which I currently don't have and no, I don't want to get a degree in economics (management, politics, etc) to create a fanwork.

However, I can use this drive, this inspiration, to learn at least basics of economics, try to construct the world of CPGtE and explore various possible plots. Even assigning the roles in this AU is no easy task, since we can't just make Catherine Black's assistant – an almost 16 years old girl from Imperial Orphanage for Tragically Orphaned Girls just doesn't have the education required for such a role.
