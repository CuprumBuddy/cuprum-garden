> _**Deinococcus radiodurans**_ is a [bacterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterium "Bacterium"), an [extremophile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile "Extremophile") and one of the most [radiation-resistant organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioresistance "Radioresistance") known. It can survive cold, [dehydration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration "Dehydration"), [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum"), and [acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid "Acid"), and therefore is known as a [polyextremophile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile#Classifications "Extremophile"). [_The Guinness Book Of World Records_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records "Guinness World Records") listed it in January 1998 as the world's most radiation-resistant bacterium or lifeform.

It also has:
- a name that can be literally translated as “radiation-resistant terrible grain/berry” (though I think it looks kinda pretty)
- the ability to survive in outer space for three years
- “Conan the Bacterium” nickname because it’s so tough
- a tendency to form tetrads (i.e. four cells live together)

Featured in [🔧 Entity Explosion〈Toby Hudson〉](https://cuprumbuddy.github.io/cuprum-garden/tools/entity-explosion/), since I needed a link about a well-defined subject to test the extension, and now-deleted Reddit post about Conan the Bacterium conveniently showed up in my RSS feed.
